Equality of time average and statistical average. Equility of dynamics and structure.
Kinetics. process to reach equilibrium. the time average and statistical average is not equal. Dynamics and structure of the system has to be studied separtely.
Complexity: how each part of the system interact that leads to the dynamics. That its structure has a nontrivial effects on its evolution, often nonlinear.</description>

      <description>A Common Mathematical Representation in Physics: Contravariant and Covariant Tensor The terms contravariant and covariant tensor often arise in the field of physics. It captures the necessity of two different kind of physical quantities that transform differently under rotation. However, most physics textbook breify mention tensor analysis as a mathematical tool with certain rules but lacking explanation on the necessity of introducing such mathematical tools in the particular setting. It is important in the study of physics because we are interested in how a physical quantity transform in different coordinate system, curvillinear coordinate system to be particular.</description>

      <title>Universality and Scale Invaraince at the Criticality of Site-Bond Percolation Network</title>

      <description>Site and bond percolation models exhibit a phase transition at a shared critical point, where both demonstrate self-similarity and scale invariance—hallmarks of continuous phase transitions. Using the Renormalization Group (RG) method in ( Citation: Sethna,&amp;#32;2020 Sethna,&amp;#32; J.&amp;#32; (2020). &amp;#32; Entropy, Order Parameters, and Complexity (2). &amp;#32; Clarendon Press. ) , which proposed a scaling procedure from the assumption of self-similar, we derive the scaling exponents for the percolation universality class. While this top-down approach offers pedagogical simplicity, it lacks the physical intuition provided by the Ginzburg-Landau framework.</description>

      <description>In this blog, we start with a qualitative overview of the small-world effect, also known as the &amp;ldquo;six degrees of separation,&amp;rdquo; followed by a quantitative analysis using computational methods, and finally, a description of the phenomenon through the framework of phase transitions and critical phenomena. From the surface level to deeper insights, I aim to explore the mechanics underlying this phenomenon and how this understanding can be extended to other large-scale phenomena.</description>

      <description>This investigation started in the consideration of quantum solids which invariably have to solve for a many-bodies quantum problem. Many particles quantum mechanics, just like its classical counter parts, is desparately intractable. The exactly solvable problem, to name a few, are the free particle, harmonics oscilator and hydrogen atom. The question is then, to solve the many-particles quantum problem with the tools we have in these solvable models. All these solvable model has a potential energy term that is invariant under a symmetrical transformation, thus allowing for specifying the quantum system with integers labeling the irreducible representation.</description>

      <description>Introduction Free Electron Model: Sommerfield Model Bands structure tells us the availible states in a unit cell. The number of electrons in a unit cell determine the occupation of those bands. One way to evaluate these effect is through the examination of the Fermi surface, which determine the equal energy surface of the electrons.
Free electron surface Sommerfeld free electron model describe \( N \) number of fermions without any interaction, not even the columbic interaction between those \(N\) electron.</description>

      <description>Can the order of physics discovery be differernt? From Zee Einstein&amp;rsquo;s Gravity in a nutshell, a hypothetical situation is proposed: a far away civilization where life was evolved from modular planet happen to understand the constancy of light before understanding electromagnetism. A brilliant physicist then could derived E.M. and gravity from the correct conception of space and time.
The derivation was casted in a simplisitc manner: By placing the potential term either inside or outside the action square root, we obtain the familiar interactions of gravity or electromagnetism, with major concepts left unexplained.</description>

      <description>From permutation to group theory Everyone knows permutation. Permutation counts the number of ways that we can exchange a set of element. Take a simple example of permutation of three objects naming it with integer (123). There are \( 3!=6 \) ways of rearranging these three elements into different orders. Let&amp;rsquo;s list out all the six orders:
$$ (123), (132), (231), (213), (312), (321)$$
Looking at a different perspective, we can also treat each permutation of the element \( (123) \) as a transformation to \( (123) \).</description>

      <description>Entropy, Order Parameters and Complexity What is statistical mechanics? Ensemble How to connect microscopic law with macroscopic phenomenon? The concept of ensemble provides a method that connects the two. Treating a large system(macroscopic) as collection of similarly prepared systems(microscopic).
Entropy Entropy to be defined as a function of probability distribution \(p_{i}\) must satisfy the following:
Maximum at \(\frac{1}{p_{i}}\) Minimum at \(p_{i} = 0 , S = 0\) Minimum at \(p_{i} = 1, S = 0\) The unique function that satisfies the above requirement is \(S=-p_{i}\log{p_{i}}\), giving rise to the information interpretation of entropy.</description>

      <description>Passive components—resistors, capacitors, and inductors—look deceptively simple on a schematic. Yet every analog circuit you’ll ever trust (filters, amplifiers, sensor front-ends, timing networks, resonators) is built on the way these three elements enforce conservation laws and store or dissipate energy. This post takes a physics-forward route into passives: starting from charge flow and electromagnetic work, we motivate Kirchhoff’s current and voltage laws, connect them to Ohm’s law, and build intuition for why “voltage drops” and “current continuity” are more than rules-of-thumb.</description>

      <description>Renormalization Group Approach in Dynamical System The renormalization group (RG) method is an approximation technique initially developed for solving strongly interacting many-body problems in quantum field theory, where perturbative solutions deviate from the actual solutions. The fundamental concept of the renormalization group approach is to eliminate irrelevant degrees of freedom in a physical system while preserving its essential characteristics ( Citation: P. Kopietz,&amp;#32;2010 P. Kopietz,&amp;#32; F.&amp;#32; (2010). &amp;#32; Introduction to the Functional Renormalization Group (1).</description>
