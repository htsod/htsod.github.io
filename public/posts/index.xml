      <title>Universality and Scale Invaraince at the Criticality of Site-Bond Percolation Network</title>

      <description>Site and bond percolation models exhibit a phase transition at a shared critical point, where both demonstrate self-similarity and scale invariance—hallmarks of continuous phase transitions. Using the Renormalization Group (RG) method in ( Citation: Sethna,&amp;#32;2020 Sethna,&amp;#32; J.&amp;#32; (2020). &amp;#32; Entropy, Order Parameters, and Complexity (2). &amp;#32; Clarendon Press. ) , which proposed a scaling procedure from the assumption of self-similar, we derive the scaling exponents for the percolation universality class. While this top-down approach offers pedagogical simplicity, it lacks the physical intuition provided by the Ginzburg-Landau framework.</description>

      <description>In this blog, we start with a qualitative overview of the small-world effect, also known as the &amp;ldquo;six degrees of separation,&amp;rdquo; followed by a quantitative analysis using computational methods, and finally, a description of the phenomenon through the framework of phase transitions and critical phenomena. From the surface level to deeper insights, I aim to explore the mechanics underlying this phenomenon and how this understanding can be extended to other large-scale phenomena.</description>

      <title>Wave Equation Approach and Matrix Method Derivation of the Schrodinger Equation</title>

      <description>Both the Schrödinger wave equation and the Heisenberg matrix method are fundamental approaches to quantum mechanics, each offering a unique perspective. To unify them, we recognize that while they approach the problem differently, they ultimately describe the same quantum phenomena.</description>

      <description>Can the order of physics discovery be differernt? From Zee Einstein&amp;rsquo;s Gravity in a nutshell, a hypothetical situation is proposed: a far away civilization where life was evolved from modular planet happen to understand the constancy of light before understanding electromagnetism. A brilliant physicist then could derived E.M. and gravity from the correct conception of space and time.
The derivation was casted in a simplisitc manner: By placing the potential term either inside or outside the action square root, we obtain the familiar interactions of gravity or electromagnetism, with major concepts left unexplained.</description>

      <title>Renormalization Group: A Descriptive Overview</title>

      <description>Renormalization Group Approach in Dynamical System The renormalization group (RG) method is an approximation technique initially developed for solving strongly interacting many-body problems in quantum field theory, where perturbative solutions deviate from the actual solutions. The fundamental concept of the renormalization group approach is to eliminate irrelevant degrees of freedom in a physical system while preserving its essential characteristics ( Citation: P. Kopietz,&amp;#32;2010 P. Kopietz,&amp;#32; F.&amp;#32; (2010). &amp;#32; Introduction to the Functional Renormalization Group (1).</description>
