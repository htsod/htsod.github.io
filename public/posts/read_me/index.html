Entropy is an emergent property, arising from the complex interactions of many-body systems. In some cases, we can simplify the behavior of weakly perturbed systems by adding microscopic interactions. However, in strongly interacting systems, complexity increases, often requiring nonlinear models. Yet, we can still derive meaningful rules at the phenomenological level to describe emergent patterns. This gives rise to two approaches in physics: starting from microscopic principles with approximations, or abstractly analyzing relevant parameters and order. When these two methods align, the gap between fundamental laws and complex phenomena is bridged.\nPhenomenological Approach The phenomenological approach to studying physical systems is a key concept I learned from Landau’s method of deriving free energy. This approach unifies theories based on symmetries and order parameters, leading to the concept of universality: systems can be categorized by their universal classes, regardless of their microscopic details.\nIn the coming weeks, I will explore several topics to further investigate these theories and applications:\nPhases transition in Random Graphs Fundamental physics often deals with elegant, simplified models. However, complex problems, such as those in social sciences, require a different approach. For example, the “six degrees of separation” observation, made in the early 20th century, wasn’t fully understood until more recently. By adjusting the length and time scales, we can study the relevant interactions leading to emergent connectivity patterns. In this blog, I will use both computational methods and RG group method to demonstrate qualitative effects and quantiative measure of random graphs.\nGinzburg-Landau Eqaution and its Applications Landau’s work on second-order phase transitions reveals that transitions between different phases involve symmetry changes that cannot occur smoothly. This leads to the concept of criticality at the phase transition point, governed by the diverging correlation length. The Ginzburg-Landau equation provides a framework for understanding such transitions, using a free energy functional that respects symmetry. In this blog, I will demonstrate phase transitions in different physical systems within this framework.\nComparative Study on Tight-binding and Free electron Model In the absence of potential, many-body electrons will follow the Fermi-Dirac distribution. By making suitable assumption about the temperature dependence of the chemical potential we were able to derive a expression relating to the thermodynamics properties of free electron. Interstingly, the states of the electrons at zero temperature will populate a Fermi-sphere. In this blog, I will explore breifly how these Fermi sphere affect the properties of physical materials such as metal.\nTight-binding model takes another approach. It assumes that the atoms equilibrate into lattice structure where each eletron is confined. The calculation leads to a modify Hamiltonian with a new ground state energy and a hopping state energy. I want to dive into the symmetry breaking aspects of the calculation and how this led to the prediction of phonon in a lattice model.\nDisclaimer 2024/10/10 The author has made every effort to reference materials accurately.

Below is a list of past blogs in chronological order: Solving the Ising Model\nMy first blog, motivated by the discovery of a continuous phase transition in the two-dimensional Ising model, which is absent in the one-dimensional case. This led me to investigate the role of dimensionality in critical phenomena.\nRenormalization Group method with Examples\nDuring a group project on logistic mapping as a mathematical model for double period bifurcations, I encountered the renormalization group (RG) method for studying dynamic stability. This blog demonstrates RG calculations on the one-dimensional Ising model, though the RG method in logistic mapping remains purely qualitative.\nTop-down derivation of Electromagnetism\nWhile reading Zee’s book on group theory, I became fascinated with his other works on quantum field theory and gravitation. One particularly interesting concept is how Maxwell’s equations can be derived, assuming no prior knowledge of gravity or electromagnetism, simply by understanding how spacetime works. This blog reproduces that derivation.\nVariational Method as Approximation to Simplify Quantum Circuit\nI’ve been captivated by the idea of quantum computation, but as I delve deeper into the topic, I find myself becoming more skeptical. Though some algorithms theoretically require far fewer resources than their classical counterparts, they demand extremely precise quantum hardware. Given the limitations imposed by the uncertainty principle, we are only closing the gap between the controllable and precision limits. During this “NISQ” period, approximation solutions are being proposed. This blog focuses on the variational method for simplifying quantum circuits. (ongoing)\nFourier Transforms: A Group Theoretic Perspective\nGroup theory and representation theory are elegant frameworks. From the perspective of group theory, Fourier transforms are simply representations of the \\(Z_{n}\\) group or U(1) group in the continuous limit. The orthogonality relations in Fourier analysis are reflected in the character orthogonality of irreducible representations. Despite the symplicity, it opens up a possiblity to explore the orthogonality in other symmetries group.\nQuantum Mechanical Historian\nIn my undergraduate study of quantum mechanics, the motivations behind the Schrödinger wavefunction and operator approaches were often overlooked. Von Neumann’s mathematical analysis unified both approaches using the concept of a Hilbert space and introduced the density matrix, a key tool in studying quantum information. This blog covers these foundational ideas.\nRecommended Reading List Group Theory Group theory in a Nutshell for Physicsts\nSymmetry, Broken Symmetry, and Topology in Modern Physics: A First Course\nMathematical Methods for Physics: An Introduction to Group Theory, Topology and Geometry\nGroup Theory: Application to the Physics of Condensed Matter\nStatistical Mechanics Statistical Mechanics: Entropy, Order Parameters, and Complexity\nAn introduction to the Ginzburg–Landau theory of phase transitions and nonequilibrium patterns\nQuantum Mechanics Introduction of Quantum Mechanics\nMathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics\n量子力学教程\nQuantum Mechanics An Experimentalist’s Approach\nQuantum Computation and Quantum Information\nCondensed Matter Reference Bibliography called, but no references ","wordCount":"1027","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://htsod.github.io/read_me/cover_page.jpg","datePublished":"2024-10-11T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2024-10-11T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Max"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://htsod.github.io/posts/read_me/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"ButterCat","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://htsod.github.io/images/cutter_cat.jpg"}}}</script><script id=MathJax-script async src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-chtml.js></script><script>MathJax={tex:{displayMath:[["\\[","\\]"],["$$","$$"]],inlineMath:[["\\(","\\)"]]}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://htsod.github.io/ accesskey=h title="ButterCat (Alt + H)"><img src=https://htsod.github.io/images/cutter_cat_hu56f3c7c30ca74edcfa530cf2c35cd698_16367_0x35_resize_q75_box.jpg alt aria-label=logo height=35>ButterCat</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://htsod.github.io/posts/ title=Posts><span>Posts</span></a></li><li><a href=https://htsod.github.io/review/ title=Reviews><span>Reviews</span></a></li><li><a href=https://htsod.github.io/archives/ title=Archive><span>Archive</span></a></li><li><a href=https://htsod.github.io/search/ title="Search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>Search</span></a></li><li><a href=https://htsod.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://htsod.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://htsod.github.io/posts/>Blog Posts</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Before you read: Here are the updates
