Here list the past blog and motivation of writing such blog in a chronological order.\nSolving the Ising Model The earliest blog is related to the solution of Ising model in one and two dimension. It was motivated by the suprise of finding a continuous phase transition in the two dimension case but not in the first dimension case. It caught me wondering what is the role of dimensionality in the critical region of phase transition.\nRenormalization Group method with Examples Along in the same period, base on my dynamics group project on logistic mapping as a mathematical model on double period I came across a rather mysterious concept of renormalization group method in studying dynamics stability. In this blog post, RG calculation on one dimensional Ising model is demonstrated. The RG method on logistic mapping remains as a pure qualitative description.\nTop-down derivation of Electromagnetism\nWhile I was reading Zee textbook on group theory, I was equally interested in the few other books that he had wrote on quantuam field theory and gravitation. It was so fun to read especially it brought the reading thinking a conceptual problem from another perspective and the math is worked out elagently. Heatly recommended. For example, this blog is a reproduction of one of the amusing argument of rederiving the maxwell equation provided we have no prior knowledge of gravity and E.M. but have the conception on how spacetime works. By either adding potential terms inside or outside the square root we basically recover gravity and Maxwellâ€™s equation.\nVariational Method as Approximation to Simplify Quantum Circuit\nI was fascinated by the possibility of a quantum computation future but as I read more about it, the more pesimestic I felt about it. Though there are numerous potential algorithm that mathematically require far less resources than the classical counter part but that requires a high precision level of quantum hardware. We know that are certain limit on precision by the uncertainty principle. So, in the end we are merely closing the gap between the controllable limit with the accuracy limit. Now there is so call NISQ period where approximation solution to certain computation problem were proposed and implemented. This blog was originlally intend to give a overview of the NISQ landscape but later focused on the realistic application of the variation method on circuit simplication. (ongoing)\nFourier Transforms: A Group Theoretic Perspective\nGroup theory and represenation theory is elagantly devised. Viewing from the lens of group theory, Fourier method is merely the representation of the translation invariance group\nQuantum Mechanical Historian\nReview\nThe review section is like a summary note on some of the fields in math or physics that I want to dive deeper into. It includes group theory, network theory (graph theory), quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics. Most of the content based on one or two textbook that I have been working on. I will have the book list posted here later on.
