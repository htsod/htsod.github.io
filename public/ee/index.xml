      <description>This article studies selected portions of the unit schematics, with particular focus on intermittent mode operation and the coordination between the bleed solenoid and dump solenoid to ensure patient safety. This blog serves as pedagogical material for understanding circuit operation and for developing structured troubleshooting strategies for Biomedical Equipment Technicians (BMETs).
We begin with the intended clinical usage of the unit, followed by a discussion of its general functional architecture and mechanical components.</description>

      <description>Passive components—resistors, capacitors, and inductors—look deceptively simple on a schematic. Yet every analog circuit is built on the way these three elements enforce conservation laws and store or dissipate energy. This post takes a physics-forward route into passives: starting from charge flow and electromagnetic work, we motivate Kirchhoff’s current and voltage laws, connect them to Ohm’s law, and build intuition for why “voltage drops” and “current continuity” are more than rules-of-thumb.</description>
