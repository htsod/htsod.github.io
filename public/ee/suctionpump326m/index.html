It incorporates a vacuum pump, control circuitry, and collection system in a compact, lightweight housing suitable for ambulances, field use, emergency rooms, and transport environments.

Retrieved from https://respiratory-therapy.com/miscellaneous/ultra-litetrade-model-326-intermittent-aspirator/?utm_source=chatgpt.com ) The USAF requires the Zoll 330M suction asporators to replace the current Zoll 326M. The original equipment manufacturer (Zoll) has issued an End of Service Life memorandum for the 326M Suction Aspirator. Despite being outdated, it contains a barebone design of an analog medical device that still serve a pedagogical purpose and provide insight to troubleshooting medical equipment device font-end.\nGeneral function The most notable feature of 326M is a Flexible suction modes. It Offers both continuous suction (steady vacuum up to approximately 550 mmHg) and programmable intermittent suction (vacuum pulses up to about 200 mmHg) to accommodate different clinical needs.\nAnd it also contains two safety mechanism to bleed excessive pressure from the vaccum pump as well as dumping the pressure as soon as the pump is OFF to ensure safe operation on the patient.\nThe unit is supported by two Power options; it can operate on mains AC power, vehicle DC power (e.g., 12 V from an ambulance), or its internal rechargeable battery, allowing several hours of use during transport or backup situations. It has a specific circuit mechanism to switch between inlet power input and the battery input and a battery charging mechanism.\nBasics Components The vacuum pump converts electrical energy into pneumatic suction, generating negative pressure to transport fluid into the collection canister. In intermittent mode, the pump is periodically switched ON and OFF according to user-defined timing parameters.\nWhen vacuum builds during operation, mechanical inertia and pneumatic dynamics may cause pressure overshoot. To prevent unsafe vacuum levels:\nThe bleed solenoid provides controlled venting of excess negative pressure. It opens when regulation is required, acting as a fine-adjustment mechanism during pump operation.\nThe dump solenoid rapidly equalizes pressure when the pump transitions to its OFF state. It opens briefly to release vacuum and ensure immediate cessation of suction at the patient interface.\nMode of operations. Continuous In continuous mode, the vacuum pump operates steadily until manually stopped. Pressure is regulated through the bleed solenoid.\nIntermittent mode The intermittent cycle proceeds as follows:\nPump ON phase — vacuum builds. Pump OFF transition — dump solenoid energizes. Pressure equalization. Cycle repeats. During vacuum build-up, both solenoids remain inactive. When the pump switches OFF, the dump solenoid opens for a preset duration to equalize pressure.\nSchematics Analysis From functional analysis, the intermittent operation requires:\nA timing circuit defining ON and OFF durations. Logic circuitry coordinating solenoid and pump states. A stable and efficient voltage source for pump drive. System architecture A simplified block diagram is reproduced in LTspice.\nThe 12 V supply feeds:\nPowerRegulator SimpleLogicControl PumpDrive The PowerRegulator generates a stable 6 V supply for logic and timing circuits.\nThe TimingCircuit produces a square wave with durations \\(\\tau_{ON}\\) and \\(\\tau_{OFF}\\). The SimpleLogicControl coordinates the bleed solenoid, dump solenoid, and pump drive according to timing state.\nThe PumpDrive converts 12 V input into a regulated 6 V output using a switching voltage regulator.\nTiming Circuit The timing circuit consist of three major subcategories. The three NOR gates on the top left corner. It is then connected to the NE555 monostable that controls the duration of the OFF state of the pump signal\\(\\tau_{OFF}\\). The bottom NE555 monostable vice versa controls the On state of the pump signal \\(\\tau_{ON}\\). The duration of the time, depending on the value of the variable resistor set \\(R_{1}, R_{2}, R_{3}\\) and \\(R_{8}, R_{9}, R_{10}\\). The TimingCircuit then does the following: taking in a \\(6V\\) input to produce a squre wave with a high of \\(6V\\) and \\(0V\\) with the a preset duration based on the time constant varies from the resistor value \\(\\tau = CR\\). For a detail discussion of the NE555 timing circuit, discuss the blog page:\n( Citation: Shirriff, 2016 Shirriff, K.(2016, 2/20). Retrieved from https://www.righto.com/2016/02/555-timer-teardown-inside-worlds-most.html ) NOR gates and RC charge/discharge creates \\(60Hz\\) Pulses It generates a self-starting square with frequency depending on the \\(RC\\) value. The expected measurement is a square wave ranging from \\(0V \\to 6V\\) with frequency of \\(50Hz\\). The accuracy of the frequency does not change the circuit operation in a significant way as long as it varies fast enough than the pump cycle. (which will be explained later from the feedback loop from output of U2 to input of A6)\nThe square wave is feed into a capacitor, which as as a differentiator. It produces positive/negative spikes depending on the rising edge and the falling edge of the square wave.\n555 Timer monostable oscillator, U1 The monostable oscillator NE555 is triggered by a negative spike (LOW) at pin TRIG. This will set the NE555 to a high and reverse biased the transistor built in the NE555. With the internal transistor reverse-biased, that opens the discharge path of the capacitor at pin DIS and the voltage across the capacitor will build-up. In the process of charging, the NE555 will remain in the set state until the capactor charge up to the threshold voltage and reverts its state to the reset state and wait for the next negative spike to be felt for the cycle to repeat.\n555 Timer monostable oscillator, U2 The bottom 555 timer, which does the exact same things as its counterpart, produce a complementary output from the top 555 timer. Functionally, the pump cannot be ON and OFF at the same time. To achieve this complementary effect, the output of the top 555 timer is connected to the TRIG pin of the bottom 555 timer. Whenever there OFF state is over, a negative spike will then be sent to TRIG pin to activate the ON pump signal, with a different time constant \\(CR\\) preset by the user.\nFeedback from U2 to A6 There is a cavieate. We know that the NOR gates are a self-oscillating circuit that in effect constantly producing the negative spike to the TRIG U1. That suggests U1 will be reverted as soon as it finish the charging cycle to the set state. But in the same time we know that U1 and U2 must be complementary in its output. While U2 in its set state, U1 must be remained in its preset state. The feedback loop from U2 OUT to A6 achieve exactly that. With U2 in its set state, it produces a high on its OUT hence a high is also felt at A6. No matter what the other input to A6, it will always produce low because of its NOR gate property. The self-oscillating character is thus suppresed by the feedback loop from U2.\nSimple logic control The SimpleLogicControl takes in the TimingCycle signal, and produce the output and control for the Bleed Solenoid, Dump Solenoid and the vaccum pump accordingly.\nInput voltage controls the state of Q1 With a LOW at its input, the NOR gate will revert it to a high, forward biasing Q1. This creates a voltage drop across R1 and forward biasing both M3 and M1.\nChanging to a high at its input will produce a LOW at Q1 base, reversing bias Q1. The transition will be felt by C1 which produces a negative spike to put U1 into a set state. Meanwhile, both M1 and M3 will be reverse biased.\nM3 sends the pump signal to the switching power regulator If a low in the SimpleLogicControl input, M3 will be forward biased, bring the pump signal to ground producing a low and turning the pump ON.\nWhereas a high in the SimpleLogicControl input will turn the pump OFF. Further details will be elaborated in the Pump Drive section. For the time being, it is important to know the states of the pump corresponding to which inputs.\nM1 controls the bleed solenoid With a low input, A3 reverts it to high which forward biased Q1. Subsequently, M1 will be forward-biased, bring bleed_sol to ground and create a voltage difference to energize the bleed solenoid. Hence, the bleed solenoid will align with the pump state to regulate the pressure; when the pump is ON, the bleed solenoid is also On. When the pump is OFF the bleed solenoid is also OFF.\nU1 controls the dump solenoid The U1 is only triggered by a negative spike induced from a transition from low to high input signal. With U1 put to a set state, it will output a high for a preset amount of time based on the time constant \\(CR\\) value. The high output will forward-biased Q3 and creates a voltage drop across the dump solenoid and energizing it. In the functional aspect, whenever the vaccum pump turn to its OFF state during the intermittent cycle, the dump value opens up to equalized the pressure.\nPump drive (Switching Voltage Regulator) The pump drive circuit design is to accommodate the needs for a stable and efficient source of power to the portable suction unit. As we have discussed, power regulation can be done simply from the PowerRegulator block, which is a linear regulator. The problem of a linear regulator is that it dissipates heat and running at around 70 \\(\\% \\) efficiency, which is not something desirable escpecially in a portable device. An alternative design, the Switching Voltage Regulator, is being used in the unit to increase power efficiency.\n( Citation: Keim, 2023 Keim, R. (2023). Closed-loop control for an LTspice switching regulator. All About Circuits Technical Article. Retrieved from https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/technical-articles/closed-loop-control-for-an-ltspice-switching-regulator/ ) Switching voltage regulator The general idea of a switching voltage regulator is to store the energy of the input DC power in the inductor. The inductor and capacitor store their energy in the form of oscillating voltage and current. So, one also has to convert the DC into some oscillating waves and feed it to the inductor. And lastly rectify the signal to produce a control output DC signal. In the circuit above, U1 and U2 are used to produce a voltage controlled Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) from the voltage divider R1 and R2. The PWM is then used to switch the PMOS transistor ON and OFF to produce a square wave to the inductor L1 where energy can be stored. Lastly, the diode and the capacitor is being used to produce a rectify and smooth DC output signal.\nMechanism With a low input pump_signal, the inverter A1 put it to a high which forward biased Q1 forcing the voltage at the comparator U2(+) to be low. A low is then felt at U1(+) result in absence of voltage at the gate of M1. The 12V is then unable to feed to the vaccum pump.\nWith a high input pump_signal, Q1 will be reverse-biased, the designed voltage will be felt at the comparator U2(+). The positive input of U2 will then be compare with the feedback signal at the negative input of U2 to send the error signal to the comparator U1 forming a negative feedback loop. The larger the difference from ideal, the larger the adjustment till it reaches its optimal designed value. U1 will then produced a control square wave with destinated duty cycle. The duty cycle is proportional to the output voltage and ideally a controlled 6V DC will be produced to drive the pump.\nTroubleshooting Considerations Understanding the mechanism at different level will allow us to troubleshoot down to its corresponding level. In a practical setting, equipment faults are generally spotted by two cases:\nThe unit is in operation and it fails to perform\nDuring calibration test where the value is off\nHalf-way troubleshooting Some troubleshooting scenarios will be proposed. Some helpful tips of troubleshooting is the Half-way troubleshooting, which comes in handy if someone could trace from the source to the symtom.\nFor example, if from mid-way the measurement is off from the expected reading, then we trace up to the source by locating another half-way between. If the mid-way measurement is good, then we trace down to the symtom half-way to locate the actual bug. This method will be demonstraed in the following scenario.\nExample Symtoms and troubleshooting suggestions Scenario 1: Pump not energized Check if the pump works under continuous mode. If continuous mode works, then troubleshoot the intermittent mode. First, identify the source to the symtom, which is 12V to 6V to Timing circuit to simple logicl control to send pump control signal, and lastly Pump control signal to pump drive power. Start from the simple logic control see if Q1 is producing the correct output. If it is reading false output, then we can trace it to the TimingCircuit. If not, we can trace it to the PumpDrive.\nScenario 2: Off-reading pressure calibration failure In this case, the pressure reading is off from the designed value with a working pump. We know the vaccum/pressure regulation is done by the bleed solenoid and the dump solenoid. So, we identify the following flow from source to symptom: 12V/6V, Timing Circuit, SimpleLogicControl, Bleed Solenoid or Dump Solenoid. Again, we will start from mid-way, Q1 in SimpleLogicControl block. Then, either to trace it back to the timing circuit or M1 for bleed_sol or M2 to dump_sol.\nScenario 3: Intermittent mode time calibration failure If only the timing of the pump operation is off from the preset value, but all the other components work as expected, then it must be a faulty TimingCircuit. We identify the flow: NOR gates oscillator, U1 NE555, U2 NE555, SimpleLogicControl and lastly to the pump drive. One can further narrow it down if either the pump has a faulty OFF time or a fault ON time. We know U1 produce the ON time signal whereas U2 produce the OFF time signal.\nConclusion Although the Zoll 326M suction pump has reached end-of-service life, its architecture presents a clear and instructive example of analog medical device design. By decomposing the system from functional behavior to circuit-level implementation, we observe how timing logic, actuator control, and power regulation integrate to ensure safe and reliable suction performance.\nThe coordination between the vacuum pump, bleed solenoid, and dump solenoid illustrates a practical hybrid control system combining mechanical dynamics with discrete logic timing. Through systematic block-level reasoning, troubleshooting becomes a structured process rather than component replacement by trial.\nStudying legacy systems such as the 326M strengthens both engineering intuition and diagnostic discipline. Understanding how power flows, signals propagate, and feedback stabilizes behavior provides insight not only for maintenance, but also for the design of future biomedical systems.\nIn this sense, the 326M serves not merely as an obsolete device, but as a compact laboratory for applied control theory, power electronics, and system-level medical engineering.\nBibliography (1995) (1995).

It Offers both continuous suction (steady vacuum up to approximately 550 mmHg) and programmable intermittent suction (vacuum pulses up to about 200 mmHg) to accommodate different clinical needs.</p><p>And it also contains two <strong>safety mechanism</strong> to bleed excessive pressure from the vaccum pump as well as dumping the pressure as soon as the pump is OFF to ensure safe operation on the patient.</p><p>The unit is supported by two <strong>Power options</strong>; it can operate on mains AC power, vehicle DC power (e.g., 12 V from an ambulance), or its internal rechargeable battery, allowing several hours of use during transport or backup situations. It has a specific circuit mechanism to switch between inlet power input and the battery input and a battery charging mechanism.</p><h3 id=basics-components>Basics Components<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#basics-components>#</a></h3><p>The <strong>vacuum pump</strong> converts electrical energy into pneumatic suction, generating negative pressure to transport fluid into the collection canister. In intermittent mode, the pump is periodically switched ON and OFF according to user-defined timing parameters.</p><p>When vacuum builds during operation, mechanical inertia and pneumatic dynamics may cause pressure overshoot. To prevent unsafe vacuum levels:</p><p>The <strong>bleed solenoid</strong> provides controlled venting of excess negative pressure. It opens when regulation is required, acting as a fine-adjustment mechanism during pump operation.</p><p>The <strong>dump solenoid</strong> rapidly equalizes pressure when the pump transitions to its OFF state. It opens briefly to release vacuum and ensure immediate cessation of suction at the patient interface.</p><h2 id=mode-of-operations>Mode of operations.<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#mode-of-operations>#</a></h2><h3 id=continuous>Continuous<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#continuous>#</a></h3><p>In continuous mode, the vacuum pump operates steadily until manually stopped. Pressure is regulated through the bleed solenoid.</p><h3 id=intermittent-mode>Intermittent mode<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#intermittent-mode>#</a></h3><p>The intermittent cycle proceeds as follows:</p><ol><li>Pump ON phase — vacuum builds.</li><li>Pump OFF transition — dump solenoid energizes.</li><li>Pressure equalization.</li><li>Cycle repeats.</li></ol><p>During vacuum build-up, both solenoids remain inactive. When the pump switches OFF, the dump solenoid opens for a preset duration to equalize pressure.</p><h2 id=schematics-analysis>Schematics Analysis<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#schematics-analysis>#</a></h2><p>From functional analysis, the intermittent operation requires:</p><ol><li>A timing circuit defining ON and OFF durations.</li><li>Logic circuitry coordinating solenoid and pump states.</li><li>A stable and efficient voltage source for pump drive.</li></ol><h3 id=system-architecture>System architecture<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#system-architecture>#</a></h3><p>A simplified block diagram is reproduced in LTspice.</p><figure class="align-center custom-class"><img loading=lazy src=/326m/figures/main_pcb.png#center width=600 height=450></figure><p>The 12 V supply feeds:</p><ul><li>PowerRegulator</li><li>SimpleLogicControl</li><li>PumpDrive</li></ul><p>The PowerRegulator generates a stable 6 V supply for logic and timing circuits.</p><p>The TimingCircuit produces a square wave with durations \(\tau_{ON}\) and \(\tau_{OFF}\). The SimpleLogicControl coordinates the bleed solenoid, dump solenoid, and pump drive according to timing state.</p><p>The PumpDrive converts 12 V input into a regulated 6 V output using a switching voltage regulator.</p><h3 id=timing-circuit>Timing Circuit<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#timing-circuit>#</a></h3><p>The timing circuit consist of three major subcategories. The three NOR gates on the top left corner. It is then connected to the NE555 monostable that controls the duration of the OFF state of the pump signal\(\tau_{OFF}\). The bottom NE555 monostable vice versa controls the On state of the pump signal \(\tau_{ON}\). The duration of the time, depending on the value of the variable resistor set \(R_{1}, R_{2}, R_{3}\) and \(R_{8}, R_{9}, R_{10}\). The TimingCircuit then does the following: taking in a \(6V\) input to produce a squre wave with a high of \(6V\) and \(0V\) with the a preset duration based on the time constant varies from the resistor value \(\tau = CR\).

The expected measurement is a square wave ranging from \(0V \to 6V\) with frequency of \(50Hz\). The accuracy of the frequency does not change the circuit operation in a significant way as long as it varies fast enough than the pump cycle. (which will be explained later from the feedback loop from output of U2 to input of A6)</p><p>The square wave is feed into a capacitor, which as as a differentiator. It produces positive/negative spikes depending on the rising edge and the falling edge of the square wave.</p><ul><li>555 Timer monostable oscillator, U1</li></ul><p>The monostable oscillator NE555 is triggered by a negative spike (LOW) at pin TRIG. This will set the NE555 to a high and reverse biased the transistor built in the NE555. With the internal transistor reverse-biased, that opens the discharge path of the capacitor at pin DIS and the voltage across the capacitor will build-up. In the process of charging, the NE555 will remain in the set state until the capactor charge up to the threshold voltage and reverts its state to the reset state and wait for the next negative spike to be felt for the cycle to repeat.</p><ul><li>555 Timer monostable oscillator, U2</li></ul><p>The bottom 555 timer, which does the exact same things as its counterpart, produce a complementary output from the top 555 timer. Functionally, the pump cannot be ON and OFF at the same time. To achieve this complementary effect, the output of the top 555 timer is connected to the TRIG pin of the bottom 555 timer. Whenever there OFF state is over, a negative spike will then be sent to TRIG pin to activate the ON pump signal, with a different time constant \(CR\) preset by the user.</p><ul><li>Feedback from U2 to A6</li></ul><p>There is a cavieate. We know that the NOR gates are a self-oscillating circuit that in effect constantly producing the negative spike to the TRIG U1. That suggests U1 will be reverted as soon as it finish the charging cycle to the set state. But in the same time we know that U1 and U2 must be complementary in its output. While U2 in its set state, U1 must be remained in its preset state. The feedback loop from U2 OUT to A6 achieve exactly that. With U2 in its set state, it produces a high on its OUT hence a high is also felt at A6. No matter what the other input to A6, it will always produce low because of its NOR gate property. The self-oscillating character is thus suppresed by the feedback loop from U2.</p><h3 id=simple-logic-control>Simple logic control<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#simple-logic-control>#</a></h3><p>The SimpleLogicControl takes in the TimingCycle signal, and produce the output and control for the Bleed Solenoid, Dump Solenoid and the vaccum pump accordingly.</p><figure class="align-center custom-class"><img loading=lazy src=/326m/figures/simple_control.png#center width=600 height=450></figure><ul><li>Input voltage controls the state of Q1</li></ul><p>With a LOW at its input, the NOR gate will revert it to a high, forward biasing Q1. This creates a voltage drop across R1 and forward biasing both M3 and M1.</p><p>Changing to a high at its input will produce a LOW at Q1 base, reversing bias Q1. The transition will be felt by C1 which produces a negative spike to put U1 into a set state. Meanwhile, both M1 and M3 will be reverse biased.</p><ul><li>M3 sends the pump signal to the switching power regulator</li></ul><p>If a <em>low</em> in the SimpleLogicControl input, M3 will be forward biased, bring the pump signal to ground producing a low and turning the pump <em>ON</em>.</p><p>Whereas a <em>high</em> in the SimpleLogicControl input will turn the pump <em>OFF</em>. Further details will be elaborated in the <strong>Pump Drive</strong> section. For the time being, it is important to know the states of the pump corresponding to which inputs.</p><ul><li>M1 controls the bleed solenoid</li></ul><p>With a <em>low</em> input, A3 reverts it to high which forward biased Q1. Subsequently, M1 will be forward-biased, bring bleed_sol to ground and create a voltage difference to energize the bleed solenoid. Hence, the bleed solenoid will align with the pump state to regulate the pressure; when the pump is ON, the bleed solenoid is also On. When the pump is OFF the bleed solenoid is also OFF.</p><ul><li>U1 controls the dump solenoid</li></ul><p>The U1 is only triggered by a negative spike induced from a transition from <em>low</em> to <em>high</em> input signal. With U1 put to a set state, it will output a high for a preset amount of time based on the time constant \(CR\) value. The high output will forward-biased Q3 and creates a voltage drop across the dump solenoid and energizing it. In the functional aspect, whenever the vaccum pump turn to its OFF state during the intermittent cycle, the dump value opens up to equalized the pressure.</p><h3 id=pump-drive-switching-voltage-regulator>Pump drive (Switching Voltage Regulator)<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#pump-drive-switching-voltage-regulator>#</a></h3><p>The pump drive circuit design is to accommodate the needs for a stable and efficient source of power to the portable suction unit. As we have discussed, power regulation can be done simply from the PowerRegulator block, which is a linear regulator. The problem of a linear regulator is that it dissipates heat and running at around 70 \(\% \) efficiency, which is not something desirable escpecially in a portable device. An alternative design, the Switching Voltage Regulator, is being used in the unit to increase power efficiency.</p><span class=hugo-cite-intext itemprop=citation>(<span class=hugo-cite-group>

The inductor and capacitor store their energy in the form of oscillating voltage and current. So, one also has to convert the DC into some oscillating waves and feed it to the inductor. And lastly rectify the signal to produce a control output DC signal. In the circuit above, U1 and U2 are used to produce a voltage controlled <strong>Pulse Width Modulation</strong> (PWM) from the voltage divider R1 and R2. The PWM is then used to switch the PMOS transistor ON and OFF to produce a square wave to the inductor L1 where energy can be stored. Lastly, the diode and the capacitor is being used to produce a rectify and smooth DC output signal.</p><ul><li>Mechanism</li></ul><p>With a <em>low</em> input pump_signal, the inverter A1 put it to a <em>high</em> which forward biased Q1 forcing the voltage at the comparator U2(+) to be low. A <em>low</em> is then felt at U1(+) result in absence of voltage at the gate of M1. The 12V is then unable to feed to the vaccum pump.</p><p>With a <em>high</em> input pump_signal, Q1 will be reverse-biased, the designed voltage will be felt at the comparator U2(+). The positive input of U2 will then be compare with the feedback signal at the negative input of U2 to send the error signal to the comparator U1 forming a negative feedback loop. The larger the difference from ideal, the larger the adjustment till it reaches its optimal designed value. U1 will then produced a control square wave with destinated duty cycle. The duty cycle is proportional to the output voltage and ideally a controlled 6V DC will be produced to drive the pump.</p><h2 id=troubleshooting-considerations>Troubleshooting Considerations<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#troubleshooting-considerations>#</a></h2><p>Understanding the mechanism at different level will allow us to troubleshoot down to its corresponding level. In a practical setting, equipment faults are generally spotted by two cases:</p><ol><li><p>The unit is in operation and it fails to perform</p></li><li><p>During calibration test where the value is off</p></li></ol><h3 id=half-way-troubleshooting>Half-way troubleshooting<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#half-way-troubleshooting>#</a></h3><p>Some troubleshooting scenarios will be proposed. Some helpful tips of troubleshooting is the <strong>Half-way troubleshooting</strong>, which comes in handy if someone could trace from the source to the symtom.</p><p>For example, if from mid-way the measurement is off from the expected reading, then we trace up to the source by locating another half-way between. If the mid-way measurement is good, then we trace down to the symtom half-way to locate the actual bug. This method will be demonstraed in the following scenario.</p><h3 id=example-symtoms-and-troubleshooting-suggestions>Example Symtoms and troubleshooting suggestions<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#example-symtoms-and-troubleshooting-suggestions>#</a></h3><ul><li>Scenario 1: <strong>Pump not energized</strong></li></ul><p>Check if the pump works under continuous mode. If continuous mode works, then troubleshoot the intermittent mode. First, identify the source to the symtom, which is 12V to 6V to Timing circuit to simple logicl control to send pump control signal, and lastly Pump control signal to pump drive power. Start from the simple logic control see if Q1 is producing the correct output. If it is reading false output, then we can trace it to the TimingCircuit. If not, we can trace it to the PumpDrive.</p><ul><li>Scenario 2: <strong>Off-reading pressure calibration failure</strong></li></ul><p>In this case, the pressure reading is off from the designed value with a working pump. We know the vaccum/pressure regulation is done by the bleed solenoid and the dump solenoid. So, we identify the following flow from source to symptom: 12V/6V, Timing Circuit, SimpleLogicControl, Bleed Solenoid or Dump Solenoid. Again, we will start from mid-way, Q1 in SimpleLogicControl block. Then, either to trace it back to the timing circuit or M1 for bleed_sol or M2 to dump_sol.</p><ul><li>Scenario 3: <strong>Intermittent mode time calibration failure</strong></li></ul><p>If only the timing of the pump operation is off from the preset value, but all the other components work as expected, then it must be a faulty TimingCircuit. We identify the flow: NOR gates oscillator, U1 NE555, U2 NE555, SimpleLogicControl and lastly to the pump drive. One can further narrow it down if either the pump has a faulty OFF time or a fault ON time. We know U1 produce the ON time signal whereas U2 produce the OFF time signal.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#conclusion>#</a></h2><p>Although the Zoll 326M suction pump has reached end-of-service life, its architecture presents a clear and instructive example of analog medical device design. By decomposing the system from functional behavior to circuit-level implementation, we observe how timing logic, actuator control, and power regulation integrate to ensure safe and reliable suction performance.</p><p>The coordination between the vacuum pump, bleed solenoid, and dump solenoid illustrates a practical hybrid control system combining mechanical dynamics with discrete logic timing. Through systematic block-level reasoning, troubleshooting becomes a structured process rather than component replacement by trial.</p><p>Studying legacy systems such as the 326M strengthens both engineering intuition and diagnostic discipline. Understanding how power flows, signals propagate, and feedback stabilizes behavior provides insight not only for maintenance, but also for the design of future biomedical systems.</p><p>In this sense, the 326M serves not merely as an obsolete device, but as a compact laboratory for applied control theory, power electronics, and system-level medical engineering.</p><h2 id=bibliography>Bibliography<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#bibliography>#</a></h2><section class=hugo-cite-bibliography><dl><div id=impact326m_manual><dt>(1995)</dt><dd><span itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/Book data-type=book><span itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/Person></span>
