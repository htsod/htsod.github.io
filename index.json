It was first introduced to tackle the problem of phase transition of ferromagnetism but later adopted into other fields of science. In this review of Ising model, I will show the steps of solving the one dimensional Ising Model by transfer matrix method.\nIntroduction For subatomic system, all interactions have to be quantum mechanical. So in deriving the Hamiltonian of the Ising Model, we need to take the coupling of the orbital and spin angular momentum into account to derive the Hamiltonian in the system.\nIn the case of ferromagnetic materials, it turn out that from theoretical and experimental investigations have so far shown that, for all ferromagnetic materials, data on the temperatuer depenednece of M fit best with the values of total angular momentum of \\( J = 1/2 \\) and gyroscopic ratio of \\( g = 2.0023\\approx 2 \\) in this model. So, we could consider only the spin degree of freedom matters. It is also reasonable that the spin interaction is short range, meaning only the nearest neighboring atoms matters to the evolution of the states of a chosen atom.\nWriting out the Hamiltonian for arbitrary dimension we get\n$$ H = -2J \\sum_{i\u0026gt;j}\\sigma_{i} \\sigma_{j} - \\mu B \\sum_{i} \\sigma_{i} $$\nWhere the \\( \\sigma \\) representing the spin of atom \\( i,j \\), and it could be positive 1 or negative 1 to denote the top spin and down spin. The first summation include all the nearest neighbor interaction where J is the interaction constant. While the second summation shows the total interaction from a external magnetic field of \\(B\\) with a magnetic constant of \\( \\mu \\).\nThe transfer matrix method aims to solve for the thermodynamic properties of the system by calculating the partition function from the Hamiltonian. Subsequently, the free energy of the system as well as its physical properties could be calculated in terms of system\u0026rsquo;s parameters such as temperature or the interaction energy.\nTransfer matrix method Writting the Hamiltonian operator in energy and re-define the constant for simplification we get the following expression\n$$ E(\\sigma) = -J \\sum_{j}^{N} \\sigma_{j} \\sigma_{j+1} - H \\sum_{j}^{N} \\sigma_{j} $$\nWith the partition function defined to be \\( Z = e^{\\beta E} \\) , where \\( beta = k_{b}T \\) and \\( k_{b} \\) is the Boltzemann constant and \\(T\\) the temperature of the system. The partition function for the one dimension Ising Model is then written as\n$$ Z_{N} = \\sum_{\\sigma} exp \\left[ k\\sum_{j}^{N} \\sigma_{j} \\sigma_{j+1} + h \\sum_{j}^{N} \\sigma_{j} \\right] $$\nBy some arithmatic derivation which we will not be going through here, the N partition function \\( Z_{N} \\) could be written as the trace of a N matrix product \\( T^{N} \\), \\( Z_{N} = tr(T^{N}) \\) where T is defined to be the transfer matrix and is given by\n$$ V = [[e^{k+h}, e^{-k}], [e^{-k}, e^{k-h}]] $$\nIt turns out that the transfer matrix is symmetric hence could be diagonlized into matrix with entries of its eigenvalues. As shown in the follwing equations\n$$ T = PDP^{-1} = P[[\\lambda_{1}, 0], [0, \\lambda_{2}]]P^{-1} $$\nCarrying out N multiplication,\n$$ T^{N} = PDP^{-1}PDP^{-1} \u0026hellip; PDP^{-1}= PD^{N}P^{-1} $$\nUsing the property of trace that the trace of a matrix would be invariant under similarity transformation, the partition function is further simplify to summation of the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix\n$$ Z_{N} = tr(PD^{N}P^{-1}) = tr(D^{N}) = \\lambda_{+}^{N} + \\lambda_{-}^{N} $$\nIn the language of thermodynamic, the partition function has the physical significant of statistical portion of a system. With all the states equally probable then the partion function of N particles captures all the macroscopic properties such as the free energy which is defined to be \\( F = \\ln{Z_{N}} \\).\nIntroducing the quantity free energy per lattice site \\( f = F/N \\), we will be looking at a expression that is independet to the size of the system.\n$$ \\beta N^{-1}F = \\ln(\\lambda_{1}) + N^{-1} \\ln \\left[ 1+ \\left( \\frac{\\lambda_{2}}{\\lambda_{1}} \\right)^{N} \\right]$$\nAssuming \\( \\lambda_{1} \u0026gt; \\lambda_{2} \\), and in the thermodynamic limit we expect \\( N \\rightarrow \\infty \\) then the last term vanish and giving us the free energy per lattice site as\n$$ f = -k_{B}T \\ln(\\lambda_{1}) $$\nSolving \\( \\lambda \\) from the transfer matrix, which yields\n$$ \\lambda_{\\pm} = e^{k}\\cosh{h} \\pm (e^{2k}\\sinh^{2}h + e^{-2k})^{1/2} $$\nSubsequently the free energy per site could be written as\n$$ f(h, T) = -k_{B}T [e^{k} \\cosh{h} + (e^{2k}\\sinh^{2}h + e^{-2k})^{1/2}]$$\nAnd the magnetization which is defined to be \\( \\frac{\\delta f(h, T)}{\\delta h}\\) could be written as\n$$ \\frac{\\delta f(h, T)}{\\delta h} = M(h, T) = \\frac{e^{k}\\sinh{\\beta H}}{(e^{2k}\\sinh^{2}\\beta H + e^{-2k})^{1/2}}$$\nWe visualize the dependence of magnetization on the external field with three different temperature values.\nAs shown in the above figure, in the lowest temperature where \\(\\beta = 1.5 \\), the spin align perfectly to the external field. As the temperature goes up, the spin orientation becomes less susceptible to the external field.\nNoting that \\( M(H, T) \\) being an analytic function for real \\( H \\) and non-zero positive \\( T \\). Meaning the physical and observable quantity in the system undergoes smooth transition with varing external magnetic field or change of temperature. Hence, there will be no phase transitions for the one dimensional Ising model.\nFinal Remarks As claimed ealier in this blog, there is no phase transition in the one dimensional Ising Model. In fact, Ising, being first one to solve the model further concluded that there will be no phase transition in arbitrary dimension. Seein the extensive application of Ising Model in various field of science we clearly know that it is not true.

This procedure underlies one of the essential properties of thermodynamics, scale invariance. Imaging we scaled down the number of atoms in a Ising model to half as much, we would expect that the thermodynamics properties would remain unchanged.\nOne could also treat the recursive step of RG method as flow and draw connection with the study of dynamical system. Different from the flow lines in dynamical system which describes the trajectory as time varies, the RG flow describes the flow as the size of the system shrinks. From this description we could quantitaively measures the scale invariance as the correlation length of the system. The fixed point in the flow lines is where the continuous phase transition takes place. The fixed point happens when the correlation length becomes zero of infinite.\nIn the case of one dimension Ising model, every resursive process scales the total number of lattice by \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) while keeping the form of partition function fixed. As a result, the coupling constant \\( g \\equiv \\frac{J}{T} \\) is mapped to \\( g^{\\prime} \\) accordingly to match the partition function.\nBy scaling the lattice point by half, the transfer matrix is rescaled as such\n$$ T^{\\prime}=e^{f^{\\prime}}[[e^{g^{\\prime}+h^{\\prime}}, e^{-g^{\\prime}}], [e^{-g^{\\prime}}, E^{g^{\\prime} - h^{\\prime}}]] = e^{2f}[e^{2g+2h} + e^{-2g}] $$\nWhich gives us three equations to solve for the three new coupling constant in terms of the old coupling constant. Writting out explicitly.\nThe renormalized external magnetic field $$ h^{\\prime} = h + \\frac{1}{2}\\ln{\\left[ \\frac{\\cosh{(2g+h)}}{\\cosh{2g-h}} \\right]} $$ In the absent of external magnetic field\nThe renormalized free energy $$ f^{\\prime} = 2f + + \\ln{\\left( 2 \\sqrt{2\\cosh{2g}} \\right)} $$\nThe renormalized nearest-neighbor interaction $$ \\tanh{g^{\\prime}} = \\tanh^{2}g $$\nThe RG flow and fixed points Defining \\( x_{0} \\) to be\n$$ x_{0} = \\tanh{\\left( \\frac{J}{T} \\right)} = \\tanh{g} $$\nwhich follows that\n$$ \\tanh{g_{1}} = x_{1} = x_{0}^{2} $$\nAnd we obtain the recursion relation of the fraction \\( g \\)\n$$ x_{n+1} = x_{n}^{2} $$ $$ x_{n} = \\tanh{\\left( \\frac{J}{T_{n}} \\right)} $$\nSince hyperbolic tangent is asmptotic to -1 and +1, hence the recursion will map the hyperbolic tangent from \\( |1| \\) to \\( 0 \\), or zero temperature to infinite temperature as we shrinks the system.\nAlternatively, the RG flow could be captured by calculating the correlation function \\( G(r_{i} - r_{j}) \\) and the correlation length \\( \\xi \\). Recall that \\( \\xi \\) is defined in terms of the asymptotic behavor of the correlation function \\( G(r_{i} - r_{j}) \\) for \\( |r_{i} - r_{j}| \\rightarrow \\infty \\), or, equivalently, in terms of the behavior of its Fourier transfrom \\( G(k) \\) for small wave vectors.\n$$ \\xi^{\\prime} \\equiv \\xi (x^{\\prime}) = \\frac{\\xi (x)}{b} $$\n$$ \\xi (x^{2}) = \\frac{\\xi (x)}{2} $$\n$$ \\xi (x) = - \\frac{a_{0}}{\\ln{x}} $$\nHence\n$$ \\xi \\sim \\frac{a}{2} e^{2J/T} $$\nBibliography Ashkan Shekaari (2021) Ashkan Shekaari,\u0026#32; M. \u0026#32; (2021). \u0026#32;Theory and simulation of the ising model.
