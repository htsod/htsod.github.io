[{"content":"Fourier Methods could be derived entirely from Group theory! As the title suggests, we could write down the whole episode of Fourier methods if we know some group theory. But why borther to derive a exisiting theory with another method. Well, Fourier methods are so important and common in our daily life. From the light we see and the sound we hear are a form of vibration that could break down into Fourier series. Those waves are the representation of a translational symmetry propagating with the plane wave with frequency proportion to the eigenvalues of the operator. This is one of the insight from Schur\u0026rsquo;s lemma, if a Hermitian operator commute with representation of the symmetry group, then \\(H\\) can be diagonalized into \\(H = \\lambda I\\) where \\(\\lambda \\) is the eigenvalues to the problem.\nIn the subsequent section, the results from representation theory will be breifly mentioned. And using these result, we derive the some of the theorem of Fourier method.\nRepresentation theory: Honestly this is all we need Probably the most important theorem in group theory was the Schur\u0026rsquo;s lemma. It says that for a given operator \\(H\\) that commute with the representation of the group \\(D(g)\\) with each group member, the operator \\(H\\) will be diagonal with constant \\(\\lambda\\) \\(H = \\lambda I\\). Following these lemma, one could derive some powerful theorem for group representation which we will not go through the detail derivation. (For interested reader, see ( Citation: Zee,\u0026#32;2016 Zee,\u0026#32; A.\u0026#32; (2016). \u0026#32; Group theory in a nutshell for physicists. \u0026#32; Princeton University Press.\u0026#32;Retrieved from\u0026#32; https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=FWkujgEACAAJ ) )\n$$ \\sum_{g}{D^{(r)\\dagger} (g)_ {j}^{i}D^{(s)}(g)_ {k}^{l}} = \\frac{N(G)}{d}\\delta_{l}^{i}\\delta_{j}^{k} $$\nIt says that when sum over the representation \\((r)\\) and \\((s)\\) of the group, in most cases the summation vanishes except when\nTaking the trace, we yield the following orthogonality relation.\nDimensions of the irreducible representations: $$ \\sum_{r}{d_{r}^{2}} = N(G) $$\nIrreducible representations are orthogonal when summed over class: $$ \\sum_{c}{n_{c}(\\chi^{(r)}(c))^{\\ast} \\chi^{(s)}(c)} = N(G) \\delta ^{rs} $$\nClasses of the group are orthogonal when summed over irreducible representation: $$ \\sum_{r}{\\chi^{(r)}(c)^{\\ast} \\chi^{(r)}(c^{\\prime})} = \\frac{N(G)}{n_{c}}\\delta^{cc^{\\prime}}$$\nNumber of irreducible representation equal to the number of class in the group\n$$ N(C) = N(R) $$\nA test on reducibility of representation \\(r\\) $$ \\sum_{c}{n_{c} \\chi^{\\ast(r)}\\chi(c)} = N(G)n_{r} $$\nIntuitively, how do we understand representation of the group. We note that group is defined how an element within the group multiply but without a way of representing these reltion its applicablity is limited. A representation preserves the multiplication structure of the group.\n$$ D(g)D(g^{\\prime}) = D(gg^{\\prime}) $$\nSo, without any lost of generality, it will be easier to work with the representation of the group (such as matrices or tensors)instead of the abstract algebraic relation of the group multiplication.\nSymmetry and $Z_{N}$ Our first exposure to Fourier Transform or Fourier method is usually associating it with periodicity, a repetition pattern in time. However, a group does not differentiate the time with any arbitrary variable as long as they have the same symmetric pattern. Say for example, we partition rotation of \\(2\\pi\\) into \\( N \\) parts. We could visualize it on the complex plane with each partition represented by \\(e^{i\\frac{2\\pi}{N}j}\\) for \\(j = 0, 1, \u0026hellip;, N-1\\). We recognize this is the \\(Z_{N}\\) group where \\(g^{N} = I\\). Since \\(Z_{N}\\) is an abelian group, then each element is a class of itself hence by the fact that the number of irreducible representation equals to the number of classes \\(N(R)=N(C)\\) each with dimension of \\(d_{r} = 1\\) by equation \\(\\sum_{N}d_{r}^{2} = N\\).\nLet\u0026rsquo;s take an educated guess of the irreducible representation. To satisfy requirement $$ D(e^{i\\frac{2\\pi}{N}j})D(e^{i\\frac{2\\pi}{N}j^{\\prime}}) = D(e^{i\\frac{2\\pi}{N}(j+j^{\\prime})}) $$\nthe representation need to be an multiplication factor in the exponent to preseve the multiplication structure. Hence, we propose\n$$ D(e^{i\\frac{2\\pi}{N}j}) = e^{i\\frac{2\\pi}{N}jk} \\quad k = 0, 1, \u0026hellip;, N-1$$\nOne could check that the multiplication structure indeed does preserved.\nNow we finally equipped to unleash the power of group theory. The orthogonality of both class and irreducible representation is saying that\n$$ \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{j=0}^{N}{e^{-i\\frac{2\\pi}{N}jk} e^{i\\frac{2\\pi}{N}jk^{\\prime}}} = \\delta^{kk^{\\prime}} $$\n$$ \\sum_{k=0}^{N}{e^{-i\\frac{2\\pi}{N}jk} e^{i\\frac{2\\pi}{N}j^{\\prime}}} = \\delta^{jj^{\\prime}} $$\nThis is the same old discrete fourier transform and inverse discrete fourier transform but entirely from group theory along.\nOkay, but how about the idea that for a given function that compose of different vibration mode. Recall that we could break down that function into weighted component of fourier parts. What do group theoretic approach has to do with this?\nWe recognize this given function as an reducible representation that contains various irreducible representation \\(n_{r}\\) times.\nSo, given the reducible representation \\(\\chi(j)\\) applying the test of reducibility gives the weight of the fourier component \\( n_{k} \\)\n$$ \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}{e^{-i\\frac{2\\pi}{N}jk} \\chi(j)}= n_{k} $$\nThen, the reducible representation can be written as the sum of each of irreducible representation with weight \\( n_{k} \\)\n$$ \\chi(j) = \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}{n_{k}e^{i\\frac{2\\pi}{N}jk}} $$\nAlso known as the Fourier series.\nContinum limit: from $Z_{N}$ to $U(1)$ and from DFT to FT Jumping from the discrete case to the continuous case require we move to the limit \\(N \\rightarrow \\infty\\) and the summation becomes \\(\\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \\rightarrow \\int_{0}^{\\infty}d\\mu(g)\\), where \\(\\mu(g)\\) is the group measure.\nNow there are two options to account for the continuous case. One being recognizing in the continuous limit the discrete group \\(Z_{N}\\) becomes \\(U(1)\\). Starting from here, we could use the methodology of continuous group to derive several orthogonality theorem. Another one being we start from our result of discrete case and take the continuous limit. Obviously, the second method will be much more straight foward but we will instead take a detour on the first method to explore more aspects on group theoretic approach.\nfind the trace \\(U(1)\\) group has the property that \\(U^{\\dagger}U = I\\). For \\(U(1)\\), it furnishes one dimension representation only and hence the trace of the representation is just the representation itself. We propose that \\(D(\\theta) = \\chi(\\theta, k) = e^{i\\theta k}\\). It clearly satisfies the unitary condition and preserve the algebraic structure of the group multiplication. The only difference is that now \\(\\theta\\) runs as continuous variable from \\(0 \u0026lt; \\theta \u0026lt;2\\pi\\).\nfind the group measure The purpose of finding a group measure is to make the integral cover the group manifold. Hence, we could intepret the group measure \\(d\\mu(g)\\) runs over the group manifold. In this trivial case of \\(U(1)\\), the group manifold is merely a cycle and hence to cover the manifold we propose the following integral \\(\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}{d\\theta}\\).\nApplying the orthogonality theorem in the discrete case we write\n$$ \\int_{U(1)}{\\chi^{\\ast}(k,g)\\chi(k^{\\prime},g)d\\mu(g)} = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi}{e^{-i\\theta k^{\\prime}}e^{i\\theta k}d\\theta} = 2\\pi \\delta_{kk^{\\prime}}$$\nFinal Remark To conclude, from the group theoretic approach, we recover the following relation\nResult from Discrete Group\nDFT $$ \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{j=0}^{N}{e^{-i\\frac{2\\pi}{N}jk} e^{i\\frac{2\\pi}{N}jk^{\\prime}}} = \\delta^{kk^{\\prime}} $$\nInverse DFT $$ \\sum_{k=0}^{N}{e^{-i\\frac{2\\pi}{N}jk} e^{i\\frac{2\\pi}{N}j^{\\prime}}} = \\delta^{jj^{\\prime}} $$\nFourier Series $$ \\chi(j) = \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}{n_{k}e^{i\\frac{2\\pi}{N}jk}} $$\nResult from Continuous Group\nFourier Transform $$ \\int_{U(1)}{\\chi^{\\ast}(k,g)\\chi(k^{\\prime},g)d\\mu(g)} = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi}{e^{-i\\theta k^{\\prime}}e^{i\\theta k}d\\theta} = 2\\pi \\delta_{kk^{\\prime}}$$\nBibliography Zee (2016) Zee,\u0026#32; A.\u0026#32; (2016). \u0026#32; Group theory in a nutshell for physicists. \u0026#32; Princeton University Press.\u0026#32;Retrieved from\u0026#32; https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=FWkujgEACAAJ Sethna (n.d.)

The contradiction of classical theorem with the microscopic phenomenon definitely is one of most stirring episode in physics which completely overwrites our oiginal understanding of wave and particle. To illustrate the weirdness of wave-particle duality, consider shotting bullet pass a wall of two equally space gap onto measurement panel. Naturally the bullet passing the first slit will be independent of the passing bullet in the second slit. Each of them will form a gassuain distribution with mean value parallel to their hole outlet.\nThe resulting measurement will be the simple addition of these two ocurrences. In other words, the density of the bullet marks simply add \\( \\rho_{12}(x) = \\rho_{1}(x) + \\rho_{2}(x) \\) because two events are independent. (unless gunman A shot at gunman B)\nIn contrast, imagine now a source of wave propagate from a distance through the wall with the exact same setting as in the bullet case. Experimentally, it shows a distinctive interference pattern that is absence in the case of bullet. The wave propagtes through each slit do not simply add to each other. Let \\( h_{1}(x)e^{i2\\pi \\nu t} \\) and \\( h_{2}(x)e^{i2\\pi \\nu t} \\) be the propagating wave through the first slit and the second slit when each slit opens individually. Because of the principle of superposition, the resulting wave through the wall will be \\( (h_{1}(x) + h_{2}(x))e^{i2\\pi \\nu t} \\). Calculate its intensity yields,\n\\( I_{12} = |h_{1}(x) + h_{2}(x)|^{2} = |h_{1}(x)|^{2} + |h_{2}(x)|^{2} + h_{1}(x)h_{2}^{\\ast} + h_{1}(x)^{\\ast}h_{2}\\)\nHence, addition to the intensity from each individual slits, there is interference terms that happen only in the case of wave propagation.\n\\( I_{12}(x) = I_{1}(x) + I_{2}(x) + I_{interference}(x) \\neq I_{1}(x) + I_{2}(x) \\)\nThese two phenomena accounts for our conception of two separate identities. Experiment on electron and a more recent experiment on the \\( C_{60} \\) molecules (heaviest molecule so far to show duality) display both qualities of wave-like and particle-like. Quoting from Feynman\u0026rsquo;s lecture on physics\n\u0026hellip; a phenomennon which is impossible, absolutely impossible, to explain in any classical way, and which has in the heart of quantum mechanics, \u0026hellip; We can not make the mystery go away by \u0026rsquo;explaining\u0026rsquo; how it works. We will just tell you how it works.\nIn addition to the apparent conflicts of wave-particle duality, quantum mechanical effect also show traces in the study of black body radiation and spectroscopy. For the black body case, we have to assume that in a microscopic level, the energy level must be discrete to agree with the experimental result. Whereas in the case of spectroscopy, it concerns the probability of transition between two energy states where it also subsumes a discrete reality.\nTying all these framents of quantum evidents together, two methods of resolution were proposed. The first method being the matrix calulus method formulated by Heisenberg, Born and Jordan. While the second method from a different starting point, the wave equation method by Schrodinger, arriving at the same numerical results. In a natural order instead of a chronological order, we begins by elaborate Schrodinger\u0026rsquo;s approach which was bought up later after Heisenberg derivation, as it is much more coherent to our ongoing discussion of wave-particle duality. The Heisenberg is like the black-magic of a theoretical physics; it takes a bit more effort to comprehend the logic flow thus will be served after the appetizer.\n( Citation: Zeng,\u0026#32;2008 Zeng,\u0026#32; J.\u0026#32; (2008). \u0026#32; 量子力学教程. \u0026#32; 科学出版社.\u0026#32;Retrieved from\u0026#32; https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=foQcPwAACAAJ ) The \u0026ldquo;wave equation\u0026rdquo; approach to quantum mechanics: abandoning the preconceived de Broglie suggests that every particles would have a wavelength that depends on the wave vector \\( |\\bold{k} = 2\\pi \\lambda| \\)\nHence, for a free particle \\( E = p^{2}/2m \\), we can relate the energy with the angular frequency \\( \\omega \\) by \\( w=E/\\hbar \\) and its wave vector \\( \\bold{k} \\) with its momentum by \\( \\bold{k} = \\bold{p}/\\hbar \\). Schrodinger was especially fond of th idea as a explanation to the wave-particle duality.\nHis works towards the derivation of the Schrodinger\u0026rsquo;s wave equation begin by P. Debye questioning.\nYou speak about waves, but where is the wave equation?\nNow historically Schrodinger find his inspiration of the wavefunction ansatz from the classical action principle.\nBut we will instead go straight to the wavefunction ansatz and derive Schrodinger equation from it.\nConsider a free particle with energy \\( E = \\frac{p^{2}}{2m} \\). By the de Broglie principle the particle has angular frequency \\( w = \\frac{E}{\\hbar} \\) with wave vector \\( \\vec{k} = \\frac{\\vec{p}}{\\hbar} \\). Let\u0026rsquo;s suggest an ansatz of the wave equation to be a plane wave\n$$ \\psi(r,t) \\sim e^{i(\\vec{k}\\cdot\\vec{r}-wt)} = e^{i(\\vec{p}\\cdot\\vec{r} -Et)/\\hbar} $$\nwe can see that\n$$ i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\psi = E \\psi $$ $$ -i\\hbar \\nabla \\psi = \\bold{p}\\psi, -\\hbar^{2}\\nabla ^{2} \\psi = p^{2}\\psi $$\nSince for free particle, \\(E = p^{2}/2m\\), we equate them to get\n$$ \\left( i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2m}\\nabla^{2} \\right)\\psi = \\left( E - \\frac{p^{2}}{2m} \\right)\\psi = 0$$\nWhich yields the Schrodinger equation for a free particle\n$$ -i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\psi = \\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2m}\\nabla^{2} \\psi $$\nThe equation is linear. See if the superposition of plane wave solution\n$$ \\psi(\\bold{r}, t) = \\frac{1}{(2\\pi \\hbar)^{3/2}} \\int{\\varphi(\\bold{p}) e^{i(\\bold{p}\\cdot\\bold{r} - Et)/\\hbar} d^{3}p} $$\nSubstituting, we see it satisfies Schrodinger equation\n$$ i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\psi = \\frac{1}{(2\\pi \\hbar)^{3/2}}\\int{\\varphi(\\bold{p}) E e^{i(\\bold{p}\\cdot\\bold{r} - Et)/\\hbar} d^{3}p } $$\n$$ -\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2m}\\nabla^{2} \\psi = \\frac{1}{(2\\pi \\hbar)^{3/2}}\\int{\\varphi(\\bold{p}) p^{2} e^{i(\\bold{p}\\cdot\\bold{r} - Et)/\\hbar} d^{3}p } $$\n$$ \\left( i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2m}\\nabla^{2} \\right)\\psi = \\int{\\varphi(\\bold{p}) \\left( E - \\frac{p^{2}}{2m} \\right)e^{i(\\bold{p}\\cdot\\bold{r} - Et)/\\hbar} d^{3}p } = 0$$\nAny linear combination of the wavepackages would satisfies the Schrodinger equation for free particles.\nOne could also see in the above derivation, we promote observables, namely the energy and momentum, to operator on wavefunction.\n$$ E \\rightarrow i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}, \\bold{p} \\rightarrow -i\\hbar \\nabla $$\nWe further consider the case particle in the potential field \\( V(\\bold{r}) \\). Base on the nonrelativistic relation of total energy, \\( E= \\frac{1}{2m}p^{2} + V(\\bold{r}) \\). Promoting to operator on wavefunction we yield the Schrodinger\u0026rsquo;s equation\n$$ i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\psi(\\bold{r}, t) = \\left[ -\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2m}\\nabla^{2} + V(\\bold{r})\\right] \\psi(\\bold{r}, t) $$\nHow does this partial differential equation answers the following:\nwave-particle duality It gives a new interpretation on matter or wave. In the Schrodinger picture, we preserve particles\u0026rsquo; mass, charge and some other kinematics properties and dispose the idea of trajectory of particles (something that we never truely observed microscopically) but instead we adopt a brand new probabilistic picture of reality. Measurement on a dynamical system is now defined probablistically as \\( \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}{\\psi^{\\ast}(x) O(x) \\psi(x)dx} \\) on observable \\(O(x)\\). With a statistical interpretation on wavefunction, \\( \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}{\\psi^{\\ast}(x)\\psi(x)dx } = 1 \\).\ndiscrete energy level The resason why this partial differential equation would lead to series of discrete energy level. As explained by Schrodinger this discretized nature is due to \u0026ldquo;boundary condition\u0026rdquo; for \\( \\psi \\) being confined in a infinite sphere. Thus the selecte values are named \u0026ldquo;characteristic values\u0026rdquo; and the solutions, that belong to them. For example in polar coordinates, the ordinary differential equation with variable \\(r\\) has two singularities at \\(r=0\\) and \\(r = \\infty\\). The resulting solution thus will only have one solution that remains bounded at \\(r=0\\) and \\(r=\\infty \\)\n( Citation: Schrödinger,\u0026#32;1926 Schrödinger,\u0026#32; E. \u0026#32; (1926). \u0026#32;An undulatory theory of the mechanics of atoms and molecules. Phys. Rev.,\u0026#32;28(6).\u0026#32;1049–1070. ) The matrix calculus approach to quantum mechanics: only the measureables matter The gut of Heisenberg bold attempt to derive his quantum perspective is best summarized the following phrase\nDiscard all hope of observing hitherto unobservable quantities\nIn the case of the elecctron, we dispose unobservable quantities such as the position and period in the theory but leaving behind observables such as energy in stationary states together with the associated frequencies defined only upon two variables that characterized the transition\n$$ w(n, n - \\alpha) = \\frac{1}{\\hbar} { W(n) - W(n - \\alpha) } $$\nwhich shows the algebraic structure of the frequency \\(w\\) with the transition in energy level \\(W\\).\nFrom the perspective of Heisenberg, there is not thing wrong with the classical theory, it is the classical variables have to redefine to match the algebraic structure of a quantum variable\nCarrying on with this logic, Heisenberg promote kinetic variables with the observables he defined to derive the quantum equivalent of some classical theories. For example\nA simple one-dimensional model of an atom consisting of an electron undergoes periodic motion For a state characterized by the label \\( n \\), fundamental frequency \\( \\omega(n) \\) and coordinate \\( x(n, t) \\), ne can represent \\(x(n,t) \\) as a Fourier series\n$$ x(n,t) = \\sum_{\\alpha=-\\infty}^{\\infty}{X_{\\alpha}(n)exp[i\\omega(n)\\alpha t]} $$\nThen, Heisenberg asks the question: \u0026lsquo;how is the quantity \\(x(t)^{2}\\)\u0026rsquo; to be represented?\u0026rsquo;. In classical theory, it would be\n$$ [x(t)]^{2} = \\sum_{\\alpha}{\\sum_{\\gamma}{X_{\\alpha}(n)X_{\\gamma}(n)e^{i\\omega(n)(\\alpha + \\gamma)t}}} = \\sum_{\\beta}{Y_{\\beta}(n)e^{i\\omega(n)\\beta t}}$$\nIn classical theory, the frequencies simply add up. The resulting algebric structure is then\n$$ Y_{\\beta}(n) = \\sum_{\\alpha}{X_{\\alpha}(n)X_{\\beta - \\alpha}(n)} $$\n$$ \\omega(n)\\beta = \\omega(n)\\alpha + \\omega(n)(\\beta - \\alpha) $$\nNote that these quantities could not be combined in the same way in the case of quantum, one crucial different is how the frequencies would combine like\n$$ \\omega(n, n-\\alpha) + \\omega(n-\\alpha, n-\\beta) = \\omega(n, n-\\beta) $$\nHence, promoting these varibales to quantum compatibles, yield the following algebraic relation\n$$ Y(n, n-\\beta) = \\sum_{\\alpha}{X(n, n-\\alpha)X(n-\\alpha, n-\\beta)} $$\nAlso known as the Heisenberg\u0026rsquo;s law for multiplying transition amplitude together. One profound characterisitics is that these promoted quantities don\u0026rsquo;t commute. These non-commutativity define the Heisenberg algrebra that could essentially allow us to solve discrete energy eigenvalues.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s see how this commutation relation be applied define the momentum and position operator to be \\(p = i\\hbar \\nabla \\) and \\( q = x \\). Its communtation relation \\( [p, q] = pq - qp = i\\hbar \\) can be verified by acting on a wavefunction \\(\\psi(x)\\).\n$$ [p, q] = -i\\hbar \\frac{\\delta }{\\delta x}(x\\psi(x)) + i \\hbar x \\frac{\\delta }{\\delta x} {\\psi(x)} $$ $$ = -i\\hbar \\psi -i\\hbar x \\psi ^{\\prime} + i\\hbar x\\psi^{\\prime} = -i \\hbar \\psi = -i \\hbar $$\nIgonoring the planck constant \\(\\hbar\\) we yield the Heisenberg algebrba \\( [ p, q ] = i\\). We move a step forward defining an operator \\(a, a^{\\dagger}\\) from the Heisenberg algebra\n$$ a = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(q+ip), a^{\\dagger} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(q-ip) $$\nThe communtation relation \\( [a, a^{\\dagger}]\\) known as Dirac algebra. Defining the Hermitian operator \\(N = aa^{\\dagger}\\). It could be diagonlized with eigenvalues of \\(n\\) and eigenvector \\(\\left| n \\right\\rangle \\).\nConsider the following communtation relation:\n$$ [a, N ] = aa^{\\dagger}a - a^{\\dagger}aa= (aa^{\\dagger} - a^{\\dagger}a)a = [a, a^{\\dagger}]a$$\nHence,\n$$ Na \\left | n \\right\\rangle = (aN - a) \\left | n \\right\\rangle = (n-1)a \\left |n \\right\\rangle$$\nThus \\(a \\left | n \\right\\rangle\\) is an eigenstate of \\( N \\) with eigenvalue equal to \\((n-1)\\).\nWrite the state \\( a\\left | n \\right\\rangle = C_{n} \\left | n-1 \\right\\rangle \\) with \\(C_{n}\\) some normalization factor. Hermitian conjuating both side yields \\( \\left\\langle n \\right| a^{\\dagger} = \\left\\langle n-1 \\right| C_{n}^{\\ast}\\). Squaring \\(a\\left| n \\right\\rangle\\)\n$$ \\left\\langle n \\right| a^{\\dagger}a \\left | n \\right\\rangle = \\left\\langle n\\right| N \\left| n \\right\\rangle = n = \\left\\langle n-1 \\right | |C_{n}^{2}| \\left | n-1 \\right\\rangle$$\nHence, the normalization factor \\(C_{n} = \\sqrt{n}\\) and the recursion relation\n$$ a \\left | n \\right\\rangle = \\sqrt{n-1} \\left| n -1 \\right\\rangle$$\nand for \\(a^{\\dagger}\\), simiarly\n$$ a^{\\dagger} \\left | n \\right\\rangle = \\sqrt{n+1} \\left| n + 1 \\right\\rangle $$\nFor \\(n\\) being a positive integer, it suggests there exists an eigenvector \\( a\\left| 1 \\right\\rangle = \\left| 0 \\right\\rangle \\) and unbounded upper eigenvector. There are two observation to be made from this creation and annihilation operators approach.\nA inifinite dimension matrix: Hilbert space The Dirac algebra can be relaized in terms of an infinite-dimensional matrix \\(A\\) with element \\(A_{n-1, n} = \\left\\langle n-1 \\right | a \\left| n \\right\\rangle \\) above the diagonal. So, does the operators \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) in the Heisenerg algebra. The operators in quantum mechanics live in the infinite dimensional space which we call it the Hilbert space.\nTop-down derivation of harmonics potential The eigenvalues of the harmonics potential is given by \\(\\frac{1}{2}(N + 1)\\). Starting from here and assuming we do not know the functional structure of the harmonics potential,\n$$ H = \\frac{1}{2}(N + 1) = \\frac{1}{2}a^{\\dagger}a + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left( (q-ip)(q+ip) + 1 \\right) $$ $$ H = \\frac{1}{2}(p^{2} + q^{2}) = -\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{d^{2}}{dx^{2}} + \\frac{1}{2}x^{2}$$\nPreciesely the Hamiltonian of the harmonic oscillator.\nNaturally, the next question we ask is if this method is general. Meaning that for any particular system with \\(k\\) degree of freedom, with matrix \\( q_{1},\u0026hellip;,q_{k},p_{1},\u0026hellip;,p_{k} \\) that satisfies the communitation rules. And for these matrices, we always find a matrix \\(H(q_{1},\u0026hellip;,q_{k},p_{1},\u0026hellip;,p_{k})\\) that could be diagonlized. In order to compare the Schrodinger wavefunction formalism and the matrix theory, this will be our starting point to transform these two distinct interpretation into one coherent quantum picture.\n( Citation: Aitchison,\u0026#32;MacManus \u0026amp; al.,\u0026#32;2004 Aitchison,\u0026#32; I.,\u0026#32; MacManus,\u0026#32; D.\u0026#32;\u0026amp;\u0026#32;Snyder,\u0026#32; T. \u0026#32; (2004). \u0026#32;Understanding heisenberg’s ’magical’ paper of july 1925: A new look at the calculational details. ) ( Citation: Zee,\u0026#32;2016 Zee,\u0026#32; A.\u0026#32; (2016). \u0026#32; Group theory in a nutshell for physicists. \u0026#32; Princeton University Press.\u0026#32;Retrieved from\u0026#32; https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=FWkujgEACAAJ ) Equivalency of these two methods Solving the eigenvalue problem\n\\(F_{z}\\) and \\(F_{\\Omega}\\) space and Hilbert space\nIn a nutshell, so far we have introduce the Schrodinger wavefunction interpretation of quantum system characterized by the Schrodinger equation\n$$ \\hat{H} \\psi(q_{1},\u0026hellip;,q_{k}, p_{1},\u0026hellip;,p_{k}) = E \\psi(q_{1},\u0026hellip;,q_{k}, p_{1},\u0026hellip;,p_{k})$$\nAnd we demonstrate the matrix method first by how Heisenberg initiate its thought on promoting the classical theory to matrix and found out that the commutation relation between observables. By an example of the communtation relation \\([p, q] = i\\) and a diagonizable matrix \\(H(p, q)\\), we were able to find out the inifinite set of eigenvalues and eigenvector that agree nicely with the wavefunction methods.\nTo show how these two methods compare to each other, we first transform the matrix method into a equivalent math problem of solving eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Subsequently we compare formalism and their math representation.\nMatrix method? eigenvalues problem in disguise! First, seek the matrices \\( q_{1},\u0026hellip;,q_{k},p_{1},\u0026hellip;,p_{k} \\) that satisfy the commutation rules. And combined to give a matrix\n$$ \\bar{H} = H(\\bar{q_{1}},\u0026hellip;,\\bar{q_{k}},\\bar{p_{1}},\u0026hellip;,\\bar{p_{k}}) $$\nwould not be a diagonal matrix. The diagonalized form could be obtained by similarity transformation\n$$ q_{i} = S^{-1}\\bar{q_{i}}S, \\quad p_{i} = S^{-1}\\bar{p_{i}}S $$\nThe communtation relation will carry over, to see this\n$$ [q, p] = S^{-1}\\bar{q}SS^{-1}\\bar{p}S - S^{-1}\\bar{p}SS^{-1}\\bar{q}S = S^{-1} [\\bar{q}, \\bar{p}] S$$\nHence, \\(\\bar{H}\\) goes over into \\( H \\) with \\(S^{-1}\\bar{H}S = H\\)\nThe only requirement from the above relation on \\(S\\) is that \\( S^{-1}\\bar{H}S \\) be a diagonal matrix where \\( \\bar{H} \\) is given.\nLet the matrix \\( \\bar{H} \\) have the elements \\(h_{\\mu \\nu}\\). the desired matrix \\(S \\) has element \\(S_{\\mu\\nu}\\), and the diagonal matrix \\(H\\) has element \\(w_{\\mu}\\), writing the matrix multiplication explicitly we got\n$$ \\sum_{\\nu}{h_{\\mu\\nu} s_{\\nu\\rho}} = w_{\\rho}\\cdot s_{\\nu\\rho} $$\nWe recognize that \\(s_{\\mu\\rho} \\) is the column vector \\( s_{1\\rho}, s_{2\\rho},\u0026hellip; \\). Hence, to specify the transformation \\(S\\) is equivalent in solving eigenvalues problem which runs as follows:\n$$ \\sum_{\\nu}{h_{\\mu\\nu}x_{\\nu}} = \\lambda \\cdot x_{\\mu} \\quad \\quad (\\mu = 1, 2, \u0026hellip;) $$\nThese set of eigenvalues and eigenvectors are essentially the only solutions. The knowledge of \\( S, H \\) determine all the solutions of the eigenvalue problem, but conversly, we can also determine \\( S, H \\) as soon as we have solved the eigenvalue problem completely.\nThe fundamental problem of the matrix theory is then the solution of the eigenvalue equation\n$$ \\sum_{nu}{h_{\\mu\\nu}x_{\\nu}} = E \\cdot x_{\\mu} \\quad \\quad (\\mu = 1, 2, \u0026hellip;) $$\nThe remaining task for us is to check that how this transformation to eigenvalues problems matches with the wavefunction formulism.\nWavefunction looking alike but not the same The defining charactersitics of the wave equation is the following\n$$ \\hat{H}\\psi(q_{1}, \u0026hellip;, q_{k}) = \\lambda \\psi(q_{1}, \u0026hellip;, q_{k}) $$\nIn which \\(H\\) is the Hamiltonian differential operator. We seek all solutions \\(\\psi(q_{1},\u0026hellip;,q_{k})\\) and \\( \\lambda \\). At first sight, this is very similar to what was required in the eigenvalue equation, which we could regard it as a function \\(x_{\\nu}\\) of the \u0026ldquo;discontinuous\u0026rdquo; variable \\(\\nu\\) which ranges over \\(1, 2,\u0026hellip;\\) corresponds to the function \\(\\psi(q_{1}, \u0026hellip;, q_{k})\\) with the \u0026ldquo;continuous\u0026rdquo; variables \\(q_{1}, \u0026hellip;, q_{k}\\), with \\(\\lambda\\) playing the same role each time.\nUpon further inspection on how these two objects transform, they do differ in a subtle way. The matrix method leads to a vector representation of the quantum state.\n$$ x_{\\mu} \\rightarrow \\sum_{\\nu}{h_{\\mu\\nu}x_{\\nu}} $$\nBut how does the wavefunction transform? We know probability is conserved in a closed quantum system and hence quantum state must undergo unitary transformation to conserve the probability.\nTo show, we first recall the norm is defined for the wavefunction\n$$ \\int{\\psi^{\\ast}(\\bold{r})\\psi(\\bold{r})d(\\bold{r})} = 1 $$\nWe expect that under transformation the norm is preserved or equivalently the total probability is conserved\n$$ \\int{\\bar{\\psi}^{\\ast}(\\bold{r})\\bar{\\psi}(\\bold{r})d\\bold{r}} = 1 $$\nLet\u0026rsquo;s define the one dimension representation of the \\(U(1)\\) be \\(e^{i\\bold{r}\\cdot\\bold{p}}\\). Then, under unitary transformation, the norm becomes\n$$ \\int{\\psi^{\\ast}(\\bold{r})e^{-i\\bold{r}\\cdot\\bold{p}}e^{i\\bold{r}\\cdot\\bold{p}}\\psi(\\bold{r})d\\bold{r}} = 1 $$\nAlso we recall that \\(\\psi(\\bold{r}) \\propto \\int{\\phi(\\bold{p})e^{i\\bold{r}\\cdot\\bold{p}}d\\bold{p}}\\). The wavefunction transform into different basis by fourier method.\nWe can indeed draw a parallel between these function. The first being vector space with well defined norm. The Schrodinger picture could also be understood as a vector with orthogonality vector and its weight. These properties are known as the Hilbert space.\n( Citation: Neumann,\u0026#32;1955 Neumann,\u0026#32; J.\u0026#32; (1955). \u0026#32; Mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics. \u0026#32; Princeton University Press.\u0026#32;Retrieved from\u0026#32; https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=JLyCo3RO4qUC ) Final Remark In the spirit of Feynnman, it will be a waste of time to put effort in making different interpretation of the quantum derivation. Nevertheless, it is still a great practice to be more thoroughly understand the historical context and mathematical motivation. Especially, when most quantum textbook often introduces these two concepts at its convience and yet never compare how these two methods differ. For it might be crucial in understanding what appraoch might be more appropriate in solving a particular quantum system.\nTo emphazie one more important aspect of such attempt to compare methods, it is that a new era of quamtum computation which heavily relies on the John Von Neumann density matrix representation of the quantum state. For this particular representation, operation of quantum mixed state and pure state is easily computed with mathematical convinence. And the ponding question of how the matrix thoery and wavefunction approach settle into one unify picture of microscopic phenomena is what drive Von Neumann to derive a representation that is irrevelent on how it\u0026rsquo;s presented.\nWe neglect some eariler motivation from Schrodinger and Heisenberg because in the development stage of a brand new theory it often took a lot of guess work to keep pushing. I particular like a quote that describe people working in the physics fontier\nIt is like exploring without a map\nSome aspects are being abbrivated such as Schrodinger\u0026rsquo;s thought on the relevence of action principle to the formulation of quantum mechanics. But it was later developed by Dirac and Feynnman that the quantum version of the action principle could be devised starting from a notion of summing of all possible paths along the initial and final states.
