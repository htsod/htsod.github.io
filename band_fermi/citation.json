    "abstract": "The concept of the Fermi surface is at the very heart of our understanding of the metallic state. Displaying intricate and often complicated shapes, the Fermi surfaces of real metals are both aesthetically beautiful and subtly powerful. A range of examples is presented of the startling array of physical phenomena whose origin can be traced to the shape of the Fermi surface, together with experimental observations of the particular Fermi surface features.",

    "abstract": "Modern electron theory of metals abounds in geometric terminology and, by using geometric ideas, provides clear descriptions of many complicated phenomena. Some problems in the theory of normal metals that can be interpreted geometrically are examined in this paper in a language accessible to many physicists. Particular attention is devoted to those phenomena and properties that are connected with qualitative (topological) changes in geometric figures such as Fermi surfaces, plane sections though such surfaces, \"belts\" on the Fermi surface, and so on. Graphical illustrations of these ideas are provided.",
