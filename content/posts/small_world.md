This investigation effort started off from a problem sets in a amazing statistical mechanics textbook by James Sethna. {{< cite "-sethna2021statistical" 10-13 >}}

## Six degree of separation: a inquiry about social cloesness

In addition to your cloesest aquitances, if you know six people preferrably internationally, then you basically could connect to everyone in this globe in a effective way. That is the description of six degree of separation first conceptualized by novelist Frigyes Karinthy. It captures the effect of drastically reduced distance by addition of few shortcuts in a social environment. Below is a youtube video that introduces this idea.

{{< youtube TcxZSmzPw8k >}}


However, it mains as a qualitative thought in 1922 because we do not have a computer to simulate and theory to quantify this social occurence.


It was not until 1998 that, Duncan J. Watts and Steven H. Strogatz who introduced a random graph procedure to study this effect quantitatively. {{< cite "-watts_collective_1998" >}}

## Networkx simulation on random graphs

The method involve generating a network (or graph interchangebly) with \\(N\\) nodes. Inbetween each nodes, its nearest neighbor is well-defined; we align them in a circle and connect to number of the nearest neighbors by the parameter \\(Z\\) for \\(Z\\) a even number for evenly distributed connection. To illustrate the procedure, below is a graph that has \\(N =20\\) and \\(Z = 4\\). The following graph is generated by networkx, a extensive python library for network theory


    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import networkx as nx
    N = 20
    Z = 4
    p = 0
    G = nx.newman_watts_strogatz_graph(N, Z, p)
    nx.draw(G, pos=nx.circular_layout(G))
    plt.draw()
    plt.savefig("simple_graph.png")

Now our intuition about how fast can we get from one point on the graph to another point on the graph depends on the shortest path. So, if we add in shortcuts randomly between these dots that are not yet connected, we could reduce the shortest distance travel. We characterize the connectivity by the average shortest distance of the graph. The algorithm to calcualte the graph average distance, the following algorithm could be used:

1. start from node \\(N_{i}\\) measure the nearest neighbors with distance \\(d\\)

2. add those distance cummulatively and now move on to those nearest neighbors and repeat step 1 until all nodes exhaust then move on to step 3

3. divide the cummulative distance by the total neighbor of \\(N_{i}\\) and yields the average distance of node \\(N_{i}\\) 

4. repeat step 1 for the next nodes \\(N_{i+1}\\) until all nodes exhaust

5. sum up the average distance of each nodes and divided by the number of nodes

Networkx has a optimized build-in function to calculate the graph shortest distance, so we just going to use it. After we know the quantitative measurement of distance of separation, we add shortcuts to the graph randomly by the parameter \\(p\\). For \\(N \times N \\) pair of nodes it will have a probability \\(p\\) to connect with another nodes. On average, there will be \\( p N Z/2 \\) shortcuts added to the graph. Next, we illustrate the network qualitatively with different parameters. For a sparsely distributed graph:

![sparse](/small_world/sparse.png)

For the sparse graph above, the average seperation can go up to \\(23\\). Whereas in the following more connected graph:

![dense](/small_world/dense.png)

The distance of separation reduces to about \\(4\\). After seeing that this model makes qualitative sense we want to know how adding the shortcuts will impact the average shortest path. To do this, we vary \\( p \\) from \\(0.001 \\) to \\( 0.1 \\) gor a graph with \\(50\\) nodes, nearest neighbor connection \\(Z = 2\\). Plotting the result as a scatter plot:

    N = 50
    Z = 2
    p = np.linspace(0.001, 1, 100)

    distance_distribution = []
    for s in p:
        G = nx.newman_watts_strogatz_graph(N, Z, s)
        avg_shortest_path = nx.average_shortest_path_length(G)
        distance_distribution.append(avg_shortest_path)

    fig,ax = plt.subplots()
    ax.scatter(p, distance_distribution)
    ax.set_ylabel("Separation")
    ax.set_xlabel("p")
    ax.set_title("Small-world effects")
    plt.savefig("small_world.png")

![small_world](/small_world/small_world.png)


Here, we observe that a dramatic decrease in the average separation \\(s\\) at small \\(p\\) region. At about \\(s = 6\\), it turns sharply from a drastic increase to asymptotic behavior towards zero distance separation. From a computer simulation and calucaltion, we recover the six degree of separation from a social science ground work.


## Renormalization Group Analysis of Random Graph

In this renormalization group approach to this random network model, it could be treated as a continuous phase transition from a regular graph to a random graph at \\( p=0 \\). Following from this perspective, we will stick to the work and argument by {{< cite "-Newman_1999" >}}, and elaborate the scaling scheme that was used to derived the scaling exponent \\(\tau=1\\). 

To begin with, unlike physical system, the random graph model is a merely a math model that has constraints and a evolution rule. If we want to make use the RG method we have to map variable for this model to the continuous phase transition which states divergent correlation length governs the behavior near the criticla point. 

As mentioned, this random graph model has two regime of symmetries. One being the regular graph in which the average distance scaled linear with the node number \\(L\\). Another being the random graph regions why the average distance scaled approximately as lograithm of \\(L\\). For a fixed \\(p\\) we will have a first shortcut at \\(\zeta\\) where \\(k\zeta \approx  1\\). We expect this will be the critical point that separates the two regions. By the assumption of continuous phase transition, the correlation length of the transition will be the dominate variable that controls the behavior about critical point and it will diverge at that point. In this case, the \\(\zeta\\) b
