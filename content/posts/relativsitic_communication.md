Relativistic Effects

Landau proof on invariant of distribution



Relativistic Modeling & Correction: Implementing algorithms in hardware (FPGAs) or software to calculate and apply corrections for known velocities and gravitational potentials.

Hardware Latency Management: Designing systems (like FPGAs for quantum proofs) to account for all physical signal travel and processing delays to maintain timing integrity.

Adaptive Systems: Developing hardware/software that can dynamically adjust for changing relativistic conditions, particularly crucial for deep space missions.
