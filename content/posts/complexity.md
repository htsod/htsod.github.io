Statistical equilibrium. Regularity arises from large N and high complexity.

Equality of time average and statistical average. Equility of dynamics and structure.

__Kinetics__. process to reach equilibrium. the time average and statistical average is not equal. Dynamics and structure of the system has to be studied separtely.

Complexity: how each part of the system interact that leads to the dynamics. That its structure has a nontrivial effects on its evolution, often nonlinear.

In __low N system__, eg. three bodies problem, the system only explore some limited parts of its phase space hence the system will lack the regularity in large N system. Many leads to chaotic system where the state of the system depends heavily on the initial condition of the system. Dynamics problem.
