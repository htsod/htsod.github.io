> In 490 BC, the Greeks defeated the Persians in the Battle of Marathon. A Greek soldier named Pheidippides ran from Marathon to Athens to announce the victory and then collapsed and died.

Although the marathon originated in 490 BC, it's truly remarkable how this ancient event still exists in modern life as a form of sport. It makes one ponder what causes the enduring presence of the marathon tradition and Pheidippides's story. I believe that any enduring tale must hold significance transcending epochs. Perhaps these include a sense of patriotism and commemorating victories in wars against aggressionâ€”social factors that may be profound, but I don't consider them the primary reasons for the marathon's endurance. Instead, the marathon signifies a profound human endeavor, a spiritual and personal challenge that stands in stark contrast to its social origins.

In every major marathon event, there are tens of thousands of participants. Surely, not everyone is striving for a top position or prize money. It's more about a personal breakthrough. Picture yourself running: the struggle to expand and contract your lungs to draw in limited oxygen, all while pushing your heart to maintain the pace. Undoubtedly, running is a physical ordeal. Yet, the runners opt to persist, despite having the option to rest at any point. A runner accustomed to a 5:00 pace endures the pain and discomfort of that pace. In order to push boundaries and make breakthroughs, they must subject themselves to higher levels of training, constantly exploring the unknown aspects of their own bodies.

Running is a simple form of exercise. All you need is a well-fitted pair of running shoes and a watch that can measure your heart rate and pace to tailor a training plan according to your physical condition. Whether you're a student or a working professional, regardless of the difficulties and pains in your life, you can lace up your running shoes and freely jog in nearby green spaces or urban areas. Life may often present circumstances that force one to yield and compromise, but choosing to run represents a self-initiated change, allowing you to maintain your own rhythm even in moments when it feels like you're going with the flow.

I particularly like the quote about running: "Pain is inevitable, suffering is optional." This means that although hardships are unavoidable in life, we can still choose to undergo training autonomously. For some people, running encompasses not only physical endurance but also a way of approaching life.


Back in high school, I found myself inexplicably drawn to sports, but I could never quite understand why I enjoyed it. Undeniably, school is a gathering place for people of the same era, and we all have various deviations in attributes. Naturally, every field has individuals performing above and below average. In terms of sports, I was above average in my class, so it's hard to deny that there's a factor of "liking something because you're better at it than others" at play. In other words, there's a social aspect to my liking of sports. However, if one solely holds onto this social factor as the main motivation, sooner or later, this enthusiasm for sports will cool down. This is because sooner or later, we'll encounter individuals who are much better than us. This applies to marathon running as well. Most people run within the crowd, and even if we pick up the pace a bit, there will still be someone ahead of us. And even if we slack off a bit, there will still be someone behind us. I believe the most crucial factor is finding inner motivation in running and then making it the primary driving force for self-improvement.

Running a full marathon is not simply a matter of adding up 42 kilometers. Even if you've trained up to 35 kilometers beforehand, the remaining 7 kilometers still pose an unknown challenge for your body. I'm grateful that I grasped this early on. With an impending exam looming, my marathon training period lasted only a week. Considering muscle recovery, the highest mileage I covered in a single day was around 16 kilometers. However, knowing my limitations, I didn't push my body excessively at the start of the race. After completing the first 21 kilometers, I realized that the rest of the journey would be uncharted territory for my body. Dynamic monitoring of my physical condition and adjusting my pace became especially crucial. The sensations of muscle soreness in the latter 20 kilometers and the faint cramping in the final 5 kilometers served as warnings for pace adjustments. Thankfully, I didn't rely solely on my stubborn spirit to force my body beyond its limits. By paying attention to my body's condition and making timely adjustments, I could prevent the worst-case scenario from happening.


As I approached the final kilometers, I assessed my body's condition and the remaining distance. With a clear understanding that crossing the finish line was certain to happen, my body felt remarkably light. My strides gradually widened, and my determination wrested control back from my pounding heart. It was as if my body had forgotten the thorny path of the first twenty kilometers and was now briskly striding forward. I believe the true moment of completion wasn't when I dashed through the crowd's cheers at the finish line, but rather when I mentally overcame the challenges during the effort, transforming pain into the past. As I crossed the vivid and vibrant finish gate and gradually immersed myself in the lively atmosphere of Ronggui, my emotions were surprisingly calm. There was no urge to celebrate, perhaps because the racecourse still stretched ahead, and I am still on my way.
