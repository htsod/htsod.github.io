As the title suggests, the entire concept of the Fourier transform can be derived if we understand some basic group theory. We start by introducing the group \\(Z_{N}\\) and its irreducible represenations. Using the orthogonality theorem, we will then derive the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and the Fourier transform (FT).\nBefore diving into the mathematics, it’s helpful to get an intuitive picture of how these two fields overlap. Fourier analysis studies the periodicities of functions. Any continuous and differentiable function can be broken down into a linear combination of its frequency components, which is the foundation of Fourier series. The Fourier transform allows us to switch between real space and frequency space representations.\nApproaching this from group theory, we recognize that an arbitrary function is a reducible representation of the group \\(Z_{N}\\). Consider a function \\(f(x)\\) that satisfies the periodic condition\n$$ f(x+na) = f(x) $$\nfor \\(n = 0, \\pm1, \\pm2, …\\). For example, a sinusoidal function \\(f(x) = Asin(\\frac{2\\pi x}{a})\\) satisfies the above condition.\nFourier methods are ubiquitous in daily life. Light and sound waves, for example, can be broken down into Fourier components. These waves represent translational symmetries, propagating as plane waves with frequencies proportional to the eigenvalues of an operator. Schur’s lemma reveals that if a Hermitian operator commutes with the representation of a symmetry group, it can be diagonalized as \\(H = \\lambda I\\) where \\(\\lambda \\) represents the eigenvalues.\nIn the next section, we’ll briefly touch on results from representation theory and use them to derive some key theorems related to the Fourier method.\nRepresentation Theory: The Core Tool One of the most significant results in group theory is Schur’s lemma. It states that if an operator \\(H\\) commutes with a group representation \\(D(g)\\), then \\(H\\) must be diagonal, with \\ \\(H = \\lambda I\\). Using this lemma, we can derive some powerful theorems in group representation theory. (For detail derivation, see ( Citation: Zee, 2016 Zee, A. (2016). Group theory in a nutshell for physicists. Princeton University Press. Retrieved from https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=FWkujgEACAAJ ) )\n$$ \\sum_{g}{D^{(r)\\dagger} (g)_ {j}^{i}D^{(s)}(g)_ {k}^{l}} = \\frac{N(G)}{d}\\delta_{l}^{i}\\delta_{j}^{k} $$\nThis relation holds when summing over group element \\(g\\) and representations \\((r)\\) and \\((s)\\) are orthogonal to each other. Some important corollaries include:\nDimensions of the irreducible representations: $$ \\sum_{r}{d_{r}^{2}} = N(G) $$\nOrthogonality of irreducible representations: $$ \\sum_{c}{n_{c}(\\chi^{(r)}(c))^{\\ast} \\chi^{(s)}(c)} = N(G) \\delta ^{rs} $$\nOrthogonality of classes: $$ \\sum_{r}{\\chi^{(r)}(c)^{\\ast} \\chi^{(r)}(c^{\\prime})} = \\frac{N(G)}{n_{c}}\\delta^{cc^{\\prime}}$$\nNumber of irreducible representation equal to the number of class in the group:\n$$ N(C) = N(R) $$\nA test on reducibility: $$ \\sum_{c}{n_{c} \\chi^{\\ast(r)}\\chi(c)} = N(G)n_{r} $$\nSymmetry and \\(Z_{N}\\) Our first exposure to the Fourier transform is often linked to periodicity, a pattern repeating in time. However, group theory doesn’t care if the pattern is in time or any other variable, as long as the symmetry holds. Consider partitioning a rotation of \\(2\\pi\\) into \\( N \\) parts on the complex plane, represented as \\(e^{i\\frac{2\\pi}{N}j}\\) for \\(j = 0, 1, …, N-1\\). This is the \\(Z_{N}\\) group where \\(g^{N} = I\\). Since \\(Z_{N}\\) is an abelian, each element forms its own class, and each irreducible representation has a dimension of 1.\nBy guessing an irreducible representation that satisfies the multiplication structure: $$ D(e^{i\\frac{2\\pi}{N}j})D(e^{i\\frac{2\\pi}{N}j^{\\prime}}) = D(e^{i\\frac{2\\pi}{N}(j+j^{\\prime})}) $$\nwe propose:\n$$ D(e^{i\\frac{2\\pi}{N}j}) = e^{i\\frac{2\\pi}{N}jk} \\quad k = 0, 1, …, N-1$$\nNow, using orthogonality:\n$$ \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{j=0}^{N}{e^{-i\\frac{2\\pi}{N}jk} e^{i\\frac{2\\pi}{N}jk^{\\prime}}} = \\delta^{kk^{\\prime}} $$\nThis gives us the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and its inverse.\nThis is the same old discrete fourier transform and inverse discrete fourier transform but entirely from group theory along.\nOkay, but how about the idea that for a given function that compose of different vibration mode. Recall that we could break down that function into weighted component of fourier parts. What do group theoretic approach has to do with this?\nWe recognize this given function as an reducible representation that contains various irreducible representation \\(n_{r}\\) times.\nSo, given the reducible representation \\(\\chi(j)\\) applying the test of reducibility gives the weight of the fourier component \\( n_{k} \\)\n$$ \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}{e^{-i\\frac{2\\pi}{N}jk} \\chi(j)}= n_{k} $$\nThen, the reducible representation can be written as the sum of each of irreducible representation with weight \\( n_{k} \\)\n$$ \\chi(j) = \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}{n_{k}e^{i\\frac{2\\pi}{N}jk}} $$\nAlso known as the Fourier series.\nContinum limit: from \\(Z_{N}\\) to \\(U(1)\\) and from DFT to FT To extend the DFT to the continuous Fourier transform (FT), we take the limit \\(N \\rightarrow \\infty\\). The discrete group \\(Z_{N}\\) becomes \\(U(1)\\), and the summation becomes integration:\n$$\\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \\rightarrow \\int_{0}^{\\infty}d\\mu(g)$$\nwhere \\(\\mu(g)\\) is the group measure.\nTo evaluate the orthogonality relation in the continuous case, one has to find the trace and the group measure as demonstrated as follow.\nfinding the trace \\(U(1)\\) group has the property that \\(U^{\\dagger}U = I\\). For \\(U(1)\\), it furnishes one dimension representation only and hence the trace of the representation is just the representation itself. We propose that \\(D(\\theta) = \\chi(\\theta, k) = e^{i\\theta k}\\). It clearly satisfies the unitary condition and preserve the algebraic structure of the group multiplication. The only difference is that now \\(\\theta\\) runs as continuous variable from \\(0 \u003c \\theta \u003c2\\pi\\).\nfinding the group measure The purpose of finding a group measure is to make the integral cover the group manifold. Hence, we could intepret the group measure \\(d\\mu(g)\\) runs over the group manifold. In this trivial case of \\(U(1)\\), the group manifold is merely a cycle and hence to cover the manifold we propose the following integral \\(\\int_{0}^{2\\pi}{d\\theta}\\).\nApplying orthogonality, we obtain:\n$$ \\int_{U(1)}{\\chi^{\\ast}(k,g)\\chi(k^{\\prime},g)d\\mu(g)} = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi}{e^{-i\\theta k^{\\prime}}e^{i\\theta k}d\\theta} = 2\\pi \\delta_{kk^{\\prime}}$$\nThus, we arrive at the Fourier transform.\nFinal Remark To summarize, from group theory, we recover the following results:\nFrom Discrete Group\nDFT:\\( \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{j=0}^{N}{e^{-i\\frac{2\\pi}{N}jk} e^{i\\frac{2\\pi}{N}jk^{\\prime}}} = \\delta^{kk^{\\prime}} \\)\nInverse DFT:\\( \\sum_{k=0}^{N}{e^{-i\\frac{2\\pi}{N}jk} e^{i\\frac{2\\pi}{N}j^{\\prime}}} = \\delta^{jj^{\\prime}} \\)\nFourier Series: \\( \\chi(j) = \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}{n_{k}e^{i\\frac{2\\pi}{N}jk}} \\)\nFrom Continuous Group\nFourier Transform: \\( \\int_{U(1)}{\\chi^{\\ast}(k,g)\\chi(k^{\\prime},g)d\\mu(g)} = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi}{e^{-i\\theta k^{\\prime}}e^{i\\theta k}d\\theta} = 2\\pi \\delta_{kk^{\\prime}} \\) One advantage of viewing the Fourier method through the lens of group theory is that it reveals Fourier methods as simply a consequence of translational symmetry. This perspective allows for potential generalizations to other orthogonality theorems, such as those based on symmetries like \\(SU(3)\\) in particle physics, which underpins the Standard Model.\nBibliography Zee (2016) Zee, A.

In this trivial case of \(U(1)\), the group manifold is merely a cycle and hence to cover the manifold we propose the following integral \(\int_{0}^{2\pi}{d\theta}\).</p><p>Applying orthogonality, we obtain:</p><p>$$ \int_{U(1)}{\chi^{\ast}(k,g)\chi(k^{\prime},g)d\mu(g)} = \int_{0}^{2\pi}{e^{-i\theta k^{\prime}}e^{i\theta k}d\theta} = 2\pi \delta_{kk^{\prime}}$$</p><p>Thus, we arrive at the Fourier transform.</p><h2 id=final-remark>Final Remark<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#final-remark>#</a></h2><p>To summarize, from group theory, we recover the following results:</p><p><strong>From Discrete Group</strong></p><ul><li><p>DFT:\( \frac{1}{N}\sum_{j=0}^{N}{e^{-i\frac{2\pi}{N}jk} e^{i\frac{2\pi}{N}jk^{\prime}}} = \delta^{kk^{\prime}} \)</p></li><li><p>Inverse DFT:\( \sum_{k=0}^{N}{e^{-i\frac{2\pi}{N}jk} e^{i\frac{2\pi}{N}j^{\prime}}} = \delta^{jj^{\prime}} \)</p></li><li><p>Fourier Series: \( \chi(j) = \sum_{k=0}^{N-1}{n_{k}e^{i\frac{2\pi}{N}jk}} \)</p></li></ul><p><strong>From Continuous Group</strong></p><ul><li>Fourier Transform: \( \int_{U(1)}{\chi^{\ast}(k,g)\chi(k^{\prime},g)d\mu(g)} = \int_{0}^{2\pi}{e^{-i\theta k^{\prime}}e^{i\theta k}d\theta} = 2\pi \delta_{kk^{\prime}} \)</li></ul><p>One advantage of viewing the Fourier method through the lens of group theory is that it reveals Fourier methods as simply a consequence of translational symmetry. This perspective allows for potential generalizations to other orthogonality theorems, such as those based on symmetries like \(SU(3)\) in particle physics, which underpins the Standard Model.</p><h2 id=bibliography>Bibliography<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#bibliography>#</a></h2><section class=hugo-cite-bibliography><dl><div id=zee2016group><dt>Zee
