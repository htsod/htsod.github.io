This blog provides a concise overview of some key noise-resilient, intermediate-scale quantum algorithms, designed for a general audience. We&rsquo;ll first explore the core mechanics of these algorithms, followed by their applicability to existing classical counterparts. Lastly, we&rsquo;ll discuss the hardware requirements necessary to implement these algorithms, with a focus on managing noise in quantum systems.
Variational Quantum Eigenvalue (VQE)
With the quantum hardware progressing, promising quantum algorithm has been devised to harness the exotic nature of quantum computer. Notably the Shor&rsquo;s algorithm and Grover search algorthm which demonstrate significant improvement over classical computer. However, those algorithms require quantum resources that are far-fetching in today quantum hardware standard. Therefore, there are several quantum algorithms that have been devised to be sufficiently useful in the noise Intermediate-scale quantum(nisq) stage of quantum information industry. One prominent algorithm is variational quantum eigensolver. It is based on the variational principle which says that an approximation quantum state that is close to the ground state of a quantum system yields a sufficiently close solution to the eigenvalues of the ground state."><meta name=author content="Max"><link rel=canonical href=https://canonical.url/to/page><meta name=google-site-verification content="XYZabc"><meta name=yandex-verification content="XYZabc"><meta name=msvalidate.01 content="XYZabc"><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.fc220c15db4aef0318bbf30adc45d33d4d7c88deff3238b23eb255afdc472ca6.css integrity="sha256-/CIMFdtK7wMYu/MK3EXTPU18iN7/MjiyPrJVr9xHLKY=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://htsod.github.io/images/cutter_cat.jpg><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://htsod.github.io/images/cutter_cat.jpg><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://htsod.github.io/images/cutter_cat.jpg><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://htsod.github.io/images/cutter_cat.jpg><link rel=mask-icon href=https://htsod.github.io/images/cutter_cat.jpg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://htsod.github.io/posts/nisq/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=UaA-123-45"></script><script>var dnt,doNotTrack=!1;if(!1&&(dnt=navigator.doNotTrack||window.doNotTrack||navigator.msDoNotTrack,doNotTrack=dnt=="1"||dnt=="yes"),!doNotTrack){window.dataLayer=window.dataLayer||[];function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments)}gtag("js",new Date),gtag("config","UaA-123-45")}</script><meta property="og:title" content="NISQ Quantum Algorithm"><meta property="og:description" content="Preview
