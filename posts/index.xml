      <description>Universality and Scale Invriance at the Criticality of Site-Bond Percolation Network
Site and bond percolation models exhibit a phase transition at a shared critical point, where both demonstrate self-similarity and scale invariance—hallmarks of continuous phase transitions. Using the Renormalization Group (RG) method from a top-down approach, which derive a scaling procedure from the assumption of self-similar, we compute the scaling exponents for the percolation universality class. While this top-down approach offers pedagogical simplicity, it lacks the physical intuition provided by the Ginzburg-Landau framework.</description>

      <description>Abstract Site and bond percolation models exhibit a phase transition at a shared critical point, where both demonstrate self-similarity and scale invariance—hallmarks of continuous phase transitions. Using the Renormalization Group (RG) method proposed in ( Citation: Sethna,&amp;#32; Sethna,&amp;#32; J.&amp;#32; (n.d.). &amp;#32; Entropy, Order Parameters, and Complexity (2). &amp;#32; Clarendon Press. ) , which proposed a scaling procedure from the assumption of self-similar, we derive the scaling exponents for the percolation universality class.</description>

      <description>This investigation began as a problem sets in the excellent statistical mechanics textbook by James Sethna. ( Citation: 2021,&amp;#32;pp.&amp;nbsp;10-13 Sethna,&amp;#32; J.&amp;#32; (2021). &amp;#32; Statistical mechanics: Entropy, order parameters, and complexity. &amp;#32; OUP Oxford. ) In this blog, we start with a qualitative overview of the small-world effect, also known as the &amp;ldquo;six degrees of separation,&amp;rdquo; followed by a quantitative analysis using computational methods, and finally, a description of the phenomenon through the framework of phase transitions and critical phenomena.</description>

      <description>This investigation started in the consideration of quantum solids which invariably have to solve for a many-bodies quantum problem. Many particles quantum mechanics, just like its classical counter parts, is desparately intractable. The exactly solvable problem, to name a few, are the free particle, harmonics oscilator and hydrogen atom. The question is then, to solve the many-particles quantum problem with the tools we have in these solvable models. All these solvable model has a potential energy term that is invariant under a symmetrical transformation, thus allowing for specifying the quantum system with integers labeling the irreducible representation.</description>

      <description>Introduction Free Electron Model: Sommerfield Model Bands structure tells us the availible states in a unit cell. The number of electrons in a unit cell determine the occupation of those bands. One way to evaluate these effect is through the examination of the Fermi surface, which determine the equal energy surface of the electrons.
Free electron surface Sommerfeld free electron model describe \( N \) number of fermions without any interaction, not even the columbic interaction between those \(N\) electron.</description>

      <description>Both the Schrödinger wave equation and the Heisenberg matrix method are fundamental approaches to quantum mechanics, each offering a unique perspective. To unify them, we recognize that while they approach the problem differently, they ultimately describe the same quantum phenomena.</description>

      <description>Relativity&amp;rsquo;s action principle constrains how light and matter interact within spacetime. By placing the potential term either inside or outside the action square root, we derive the familiar interactions of gravity or electromagnetism between matter. This post offers a top-down view of electromagnetism&amp;rsquo;s derivation from these fundamental principles.
Relativistic Action To incorporate relativistic effects, the action is written as:
$$ S = -m \int{ \sqrt{-\eta_{\mu \nu} dx^{\mu} dx^{\nu}} } = -m \sqrt{dt^{2} - d\vec{x}^{2}} $$</description>

      <description>Renormalization Group Approach in Dynamical System The renormalization group (RG) method is an approximation technique initially developed for solving strongly interacting many-body problems in quantum field theory, where perturbative solutions deviate from the actual solutions. The fundamental concept of the renormalization group approach is to eliminate irrelevant degrees of freedom in a physical system while preserving its essential characteristics ( Citation: P. Kopietz,&amp;#32;2010 P. Kopietz,&amp;#32; F.&amp;#32; (2010). &amp;#32; Introduction to the Functional Renormalization Group (1).</description>
