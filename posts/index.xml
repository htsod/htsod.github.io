      <description>Along in the journey of studying quantum mechanics, we recognize the experimental weirdness of this field of study, poking its strangeness with different method of approaches. We throw away the ones that deviate from experiment leaving behind the one that hold true under test. One might stop and ponder how different approaches lead to the exact same result regardless of their different starting point and interpretation.</description>

      <description>Relativisty action principle constrain how light and matters could interact within our spacetime. By placing the potential term either inside or outside the action square root, we get gravity or electromagnetism interaction between matters
Relativistic Action The action taking into the relativistic effect could be written as the following integral
$$ S = -m \int{ \sqrt{-\eta_{\mu \nu} dx^{\mu} dx^{\nu}} } = -m \sqrt{dt^{2} - d\vec{x}^{2}} $$
In contrast, the classical action with the potential term added is stated as</description>
