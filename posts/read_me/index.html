Using the Renormalization Group (RG) method from a top-down approach, which derive a scaling procedure from the assumption of self-similar, we compute the scaling exponents for the percolation universality class. While this top-down approach offers pedagogical simplicity, it lacks the physical intuition provided by the Ginzburg-Landau framework. To bridge this gap, we explore a cross-referenced analysis of these two approaches, aiming to deepen our understanding of network percolation phenomena.\nPhases Transition and Renormalization Group method applied in Random Graphs Model\nFundamental physics often deals with elegant, simplified models. However, complex problems, such as those in social sciences, require a different approach. For example, the “six degrees of separation” observation, made in the early 20th century, wasn’t fully understood until more recently. By adjusting the length and time scales, we can study the relevant interactions leading to emergent connectivity patterns. In this blog, I will use both computational methods and RG group method to demonstrate qualitative effects and quantiative measure of random graphs.\nGroup Theory Application in Quantum Mechanics (drafting)\nThis blog mainly focus on the symmetries in the quantum theory, starting from the simplest solution of hydrogen atom, a case that respects the rotational symmetry. Then, to more complicated situation such as in the molecular case and spatially repeating lattice, a case that respects translational symmetry, emphazising the connection between the symmetries of the problem and the form of the solutions.\nFermi suface: A Geometry Interpretation of Conductors (drafting)\nProvide a comprehensive review of Fermiology.\nSolving the Ising Model\nMy first blog, motivated by the discovery of a continuous phase transition in the two-dimensional Ising model, which is absent in the one-dimensional case. This led me to investigate the role of dimensionality in critical phenomena.\nRenormalization Group method with Examples\nDuring a group project on logistic mapping as a mathematical model for double period bifurcations, I encountered the renormalization group (RG) method for studying dynamic stability. This blog demonstrates RG calculations on the one-dimensional Ising model, though the RG method in logistic mapping remains purely qualitative.\nTop-down derivation of Electromagnetism\nWhile reading Zee’s book on group theory, I became fascinated with his other works on quantum field theory and gravitation. One particularly interesting concept is how Maxwell’s equations can be derived, assuming no prior knowledge of gravity or electromagnetism, simply by understanding how spacetime works. This blog reproduces that derivation.\nFourier Transforms: A Group Theoretic Perspective\nGroup theory and representation theory are elegant frameworks. From the perspective of group theory, Fourier transforms are simply representations of the \\(Z_{n}\\) group or U(1) group in the continuous limit. The orthogonality relations in Fourier analysis are reflected in the character orthogonality of irreducible representations. Despite the symplicity, it opens up a possiblity to explore the orthogonality in other symmetries group.\nQuantum Mechanical Historian\nIn my undergraduate study of quantum mechanics, the motivations behind the Schrödinger wavefunction and operator approaches were often overlooked. Von Neumann’s mathematical analysis unified both approaches using the concept of a Hilbert space and introduced the density matrix, a key tool in studying quantum information. This blog covers these foundational ideas.\n","wordCount":"547","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://htsod.github.io/read_me/universality_cover.jpg","datePublished":"2025-01-18T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2025-01-11T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Max"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://htsod.github.io/posts/read_me/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"ButterCat","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://htsod.github.io/images/cutter_cat.jpg"}}}</script><script id=MathJax-script async src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-chtml.js></script><script>MathJax={tex:{displayMath:[["\\[","\\]"],["$$","$$"]],inlineMath:[["\\(","\\)"]]}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://htsod.github.io/ accesskey=h title="ButterCat (Alt + H)"><img src=https://htsod.github.io/images/cutter_cat_hu56f3c7c30ca74edcfa530cf2c35cd698_16367_0x35_resize_q75_box.jpg alt aria-label=logo height=35>ButterCat</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://htsod.github.io/posts/ title=Posts><span>Posts</span></a></li><li><a href=https://htsod.github.io/archives/ title=Archive><span>Archive</span></a></li><li><a href=https://htsod.github.io/search/ title="Search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>Search</span></a></li><li><a href=https://htsod.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://htsod.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://htsod.github.io/posts/>Blog Posts</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">README</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2025-01-18 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>January 18, 2025</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;3 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;547 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Max&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/read_me.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><figure class=entry-cover><img loading=eager srcset="https://htsod.github.io/read_me/universality_cover_hu63dc6372e245e7c231327027167f0aff_92354_360x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 360w ,https://htsod.github.io/read_me/universality_cover_hu63dc6372e245e7c231327027167f0aff_92354_480x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 480w ,https://htsod.github.io/read_me/universality_cover_hu63dc6372e245e7c231327027167f0aff_92354_720x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 720w ,https://htsod.github.io/read_me/universality_cover.jpg 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 768px) 720px, 100vw" src=https://htsod.github.io/read_me/universality_cover.jpg alt width=1000 height=500><p>Site-Bond percolation networks showing universality and scaling invariance at criticality.
