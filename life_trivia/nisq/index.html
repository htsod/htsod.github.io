It is based on the variational principle which says that an approximation quantum state that is close to the ground state of a quantum system yields a sufficiently close solution to the eigenvalues of the ground state.\n$$ \\left \\langle \\psi(\\theta) \\right | H \\left | \\psi(\\theta)\\right\\rangle = \\lambda_{approx} \\ge \\lambda_{g} = \\left \\langle \\psi_{g} \\right | H \\left | \\psi_{g} \\right\\rangle$$\nHere we parameterized the state $\\psi(\\theta)$ to be trained on a classical computation iteratively by measuring the eigenvalue using a quantum circuit.
