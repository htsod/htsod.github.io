               geometrical mechanics. §3. The significance of wave-length;

               wave-equation and its application to the hydrogen atom. §5. The

               look at the calculational details",

  abstract  = "In July 1925 Heisenberg published a paper [Z. Phys. 33, 879-893
               (1925)] which ended the period of `the Old Quantum Theory' and
               ushered in the new era of Quantum Mechanics. This epoch-making
               paper is generally regarded as being difficult to follow,
               perhaps partly because Heisenberg provided few clues as to how
               he arrived at the results which he reported. Here we give
               details of calculations of the type which, we suggest,
               Heisenberg may have performed. We take as a specific example one
               of the anharmonic oscillator problems considered by Heisenberg,
               and use our reconstruction of his approach to solve it up to
               second order in perturbation theory. We emphasize that the
               results are precisely those obtained in standard quantum
               mechanics, and suggest that some discussion of the approach -
               based on the direct computation of transition amplitudes - could
               usefully be included in undergraduate courses in quantum
               mechanics.",

@ARTICLE{Dirac1925-gz,

  author    = "Dirac, P A M",
  abstract  = "It is well known that the experimental facts of atomic physics
               necessitate a departure from the classical theory of
               electrodynamics in the description of atomic phenomena. This
               departure takes the form, in Bohr's theory, of the special
               assumptions of the existence of stationary states of an atom, in
               which it does not radiate, and of certain rules, called quantum
               conditions, which fix the stationary states and the frequencies
               of the radiation emitted during transitions between them. These
               assumptions are quite foreign to the classical theory, but have
               been very successful in the interpretation of a restricted
               region of atomic phenomena. The only way in which the classical
               theory is used is through the assumption that the classical laws
               hold for the description of the motion in the stationary states,
               although they fail completely during transitions, and the
               assumption, called the Correspondence Principle, that the
               classical theory gives the right results in the limiting case
               when the action per cycle of the system is large compared to
               Planck's constant h , and in certain other special cases. In a
               recent paper Heisenberg puts forward a new theory, which
               suggests that it is not the equations of classical mechanics
               that are in any way at fault, but that the mathematical
               operations by which physical results are deduced from them
               require modification. All the information supplied by the
               classical theory can thus be made use of in the new theory.",
